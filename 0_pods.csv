Take 1 the first night. If tolerated well, take 2 the second night. If tolerated well, take the full dosage of 3 capsules going forward. Don’t be afraid to pause or reduce the dosage until your body adjusts!\n\nBe Well Magnesium delivers 4 types of magnesium, including 500mg of superiorly absorbed sucrosomial magnesium.

This critical mineral is involved in 300+ biochemical reactions in the body – including ones that help you relax, unwind, and sleep deeply.\n\nI created Be Well Magnesium because I was tired of combining different brands of magnesium to get the full support I wanted for: ✔️Calm  ✔️Sleep  ✔️Mood. \n\nWith at least 11 different types of known magnesium, each one is different in what it targets and how efficiently the body can utilize it. That’s why quality and thoughtfulness matter when it comes to choosing your magnesium supplement. \n\nBe Well Magnesium is one-of-a kind for a few key reasons:\n\nI enriched my formula with 3 intentional ingredients to promote max relaxation:\nGABA – calming neurotransmitter that helps quiet the mind\nL-theanine – supports alpha brain waves for focused relaxation\nVitamin B6 – essential for making serotonin\nI use a blend of 4 different types of magnesium in order to target multiple benefits\nI use sucrosomial magnesium, which is absorbed more efficiently than other types of magnesium (such as magnesium oxide or magnesium bisglycinate) but also has less side effects. It outperforms other magnesium types, as it bypasses stomach acid and is absorbed directly in the intestines. \n\nBe Well Magnesium is a gentle, synergistic formula designed to support your nervous system and ease you into rest naturally. Because sleep shouldn’t be a struggle. \n\nI can’t wait for you to experience firsthand the transformative power of Be Well Magnesium.

Angela Haas shares a behind-the-scenes look at writing science fiction and romantic comedy!\n\n\nIn today’s episode, we’re going behind the scenes of Angela Haas’s journey to hear how she self-published not one but two books in the last six months—one’s that’s a really fun space opera and the other that’s a romantic comedy. You’ll hear about her experience working with book editors, how she approaches the writing process as a die-hard pantser, and what made her choose self-publishing for all three of her books.\n\n\nIn the episode, you’ll hear us talk about things like:\n\n  •  [06:50] What happened when Angela submitted her outline for feedback in an online writing course (it wasn’t mine!) and got negative feedback from the instructor who called her space opera story “spoofy”\n  •  [13:45] How understanding this one writing technique (spoiler alert: it’s “show, don’t tell\"") helped improve the quality of Angela’s manuscripts, and what exactly made this tricky concept finally make sense\n  •  [15:05] What made Angela (a die-hard pantser) finally embrace outlining—and what her unique approach to outlining looks like (spoiler alert: it’s flexible and creative, something all pantsers would love!)\n  •  [17:45] What happened when Angela hired an editor who started re-writing passages from her story (and why this almost made her give up on writing altogether)\n  •  [20:10] Why Angela decided to self-publish both of her books—including what she learned from researching traditional publishing and indie publishing and the factors that made her choose self-publishing\n\nIf you’re an aspiring author who dreams of self-publishing a novel to have more control over the creative process, you’re going to love this episode!\n\n\n🔗 Links mentioned in this episode:\n\n  •  Angela Haas’s Website (https://ahaaswrites.com/) \n  •  Angela Haas on Instagram (https://www.instagram.com/angelam_haas/) \n  •  Angela Haas’s Books (https://www.amazon.com/stores/author/B0B44XC9ZQ) \n  •  The Author Next Door Show (https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-author-next-door/id1790948351) \n\n⭐ Rate + Review + Follow on Apple Podcasts\n\n\n\""I love the Fiction Writing Made Easy podcast!\"" ← If that sounds like you, please consider rating and reviewing this show!

En este episodio esclarecedor, Elena nos ofrece una mirada comprensiva y detallada sobre los desafíos y tabúes del divorcio.\n\nDurante nuestra conversación, Elena aborda cómo gestionar un divorcio de la manera más saludable posible, subrayando la importancia de elegir un buen abogado de familia y de contar con apoyo profesional durante estas tormentas personales. También exploramos la importancia del cuidado personal y la necesidad de relanzar carreras personales que a menudo quedan en pausa o son descuidadas durante el matrimonio.\n\nAdemás, tocamos algunos temas poco discutidos pero significativos: la infidelidad financiera y los acuerdos prenupciales y post nupciales.

We get into everything from the guy's love of “Heavyweights”, what really happens at NFL training camps, who’s idea it was for Tom Cruise to dance in “Tropic Thunder”, if Ben would give up an Academy Award for a Knicks Title, and all of Jason and Travis’ biggest questions about “Severance.” \n\nFinally, we have potentially the least helpful March Madness breakdown of all time. If your criteria for picking teams involves fighting ability, if they shoot underhand free throws, higher GPAs, or any other broad generalizations, this bracket preview is for you! \n\nYou can participate in the New Heights March Madness Bracket Challenge with the links below: \nMen's Bracket Link: https://bit.ly/NHMensBracket\nWomen's Bracket Link: https://bit.ly/NHWomensBracket\n\nYou can listen to new episodes early and ad-free on Wondery+.

Plus, it’s a doomscroll double feature because a photo of baby Kylie (all 12 lbs 1 oz of her) has resurfaced and Kylie shares her theory on second kids being built “sturdy.”\n\nAfter that, Kylie debuts a new segment tentatively called “Charity and Yap” until Queen Emma thinks of something better. Kylie shares that she and Jason have something very special up for auction at this year’s 2025 Night of Too Many Stars event benefiting the NEXT For Autism organization. \n\nKylie’s then joined by the woman she claims she may have the “least business” talking to in the entire world, former First Lady, Michelle Obama. Kylie asks Mrs. Obama about her brand new podcast “IMO” that she hosts with her brother Craig Robinson and why they wanted to start the show together. \n\nMrs. Obama and Kylie then get into the benefits of girl dads and the realities of raising teenage daughters at The White House. Michelle talks about the importance of making sure her daughters were prepared for the world once they moved out and what it was like when they were doing regular teen things like learning to drive and going to parties.\n\nKylie shares how much she appreciated Mrs. Obama’s “Let’s Move” campaign and asks her about partnering with the NFL on it, the changes to school lunches that resulted from it and why that cause was initially so important to her. \n\nLastly, since they’re both exactly 5’11”, Kylie asks Michelle Obama about her feelings on growing up as a tall girl and the two of them bond over guys lying about their heights in their dating years and now being proud to wear heels.\n\nAs always, make sure you tune into More Sh*t Monday on the Not Gonna Lie YouTube channel for exclusive clips from Kylie’s longer conversation with Michelle Obama.\n.\n.\n.\nDownload the full podcast here:\nApple: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/not-gonna-lie-with-kylie-kelce/id1780888125\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/0RgXbSGGmwpzAyeLHbDqUD?si=4585dab89c4f4c11&nd=1&dlsi=e178bf324b99403f\n\nFollow Not Gonna Lie on Social Media for all the best moments from the show: \nlnk.to/j61XD8\n\nSupport the Show:  \n\nLiquid Death: Go to http://liquiddeath.com/kylie for $2 off any 2 six-packs!

The creaky floors and cozy corners in that story actually helped inspire me to write a whole book.\n\nLately, I’ve been thinking about how brave it is to share what’s in your heart-what you feel called to offer. It may not land with everyone, but it might be exactly what someone out there needs.\n\nThank you for being part of this village.

Drawing from Marcus' experiences leading Rome through war and plague, I explore how his preoccupation with death wasn’t morbid, but practical—an attempt to remain aligned with Nature and his duty within the Cosmopolis. Death, like birth, is part of the universal order, and Stoicism teaches us that fearing it contradicts the very reason and nature we’re trying to live in accordance with.\n\nI also answer a listener question about the tension between patience and passivity. When someone wrongs us repeatedly, how do we maintain Stoic endurance without becoming doormats? I break down how context and role-based duties shape what it means to act justly, and I offer practical strategies for staying true to Stoic principles while setting boundaries that honor both ourselves and others.\n\nMidlife folks, click here: https://stoicismpod.com/midlife\n\nMeditations 4.5\nDeath is such as generation is, a mystery of nature… not a thing of which any man should be ashamed, for it is not contrary to the nature of a reasonable animal, and not contrary to the reason of our constitution.\n\nTHREE TAKEAWAYS\n— Death is neither good nor bad—it’s a natural process necessary to life itself.\n— Stoic practice requires continual habituation, especially around fear and mortality.\n— Setting boundaries is not un-Stoic when done with reason and care for all parties involved.\n\nJoin the Practical Stoicism community, the Society of Stoics, at https://community.stoicismpod.com.

In this episode, I tackle one of the most difficult and emotionally heavy questions I’ve ever received from a listener. The question challenges a central Stoic claim: if everything other than Virtue and Vice is morally indifferent, how do we account for actions that seem obviously evil?\n\nTo answer this, I break down the two definitions of “indifferent” in Stoic thought and explain why Stoicism insists that context, not the physical action itself, determines moral value. This isn’t academic nitpicking—it’s essential for understanding what Stoicism actually teaches about justice, virtue, and moral responsibility.\n\n🔹 Why Virtue is always Good—and Vice is always Evil\n🔹 The two definitions of “indifferents” in Stoicism\n🔹 Why horrific acts like rape are always unjust and vicious\n🔹 How Stoicism distinguishes between action and context\n🔹 Why context—not the act—determines moral quality\n\nThis is a difficult episode, but it’s also a necessary one for anyone who wants to understand Stoic ethics at its deepest and most serious level. If Stoicism is your life philosophy, you need to know why it's equipped to handle even the hardest moral questions.\n\n📖 “If we don’t know why something is wrong, we can’t be sure we’ve gotten it right.”\n\nThanks for watching.

This story isn’t about perfection, it’s about progress—and how even a near-slip can teach us something meaningful.\n\nStoicism doesn’t promise that we’ll never get angry or annoyed. But it does help us build inner safeguards that keep our worst moments from becoming something we regret. I reflect on what went wrong, what went right, and how vigilance—prosochē—is at the heart of every successful Stoic practice.\n\n🔹 Why I almost lost my temper on a train\n🔹 What prosochē really looks like in daily life\n🔹 How Stoic training changes our “worst” over time\n🔹 Why internal safeguards matter more than strict rules\n🔹 What it means to slip without falling\n\nThis episode is a reminder that paying attention—moment to moment—is the true bedrock of Stoic living. Even experienced practitioners lose focus sometimes. What matters most is how we respond.\n\n📖 “Pay attention like your entire practice of Stoicism depends on it.

In his talk, Dr. Barry Kudrowitz explores how cartoons, comics, and science fiction are more than just entertainment for kids and \""kidults\""—they are a critical player in advancing society and technology. Absurd concepts presented in children's media can be just shy of being innovative -- just one step away from feasibility or value in the zone of the \""adjacent possible\"". From The Simpsons to Jules Verne, he reveals the surprising ways imaginative and playful storytelling initiates a critical dialogue between writers and animators and scientists and engineers which leads to innovation and real-world technological advancements. \n\nDr. Barry Kudrowitz explores innovation through the intersection of design, humor, and play in everyday life. He is a professor, researcher, and department head at the University of Minnesota. His recent book \""Sparking Creativity: How Play and Humor Fuel Innovation and Design\"" draws from 19 years of academic research into how playfulness fosters creativity and problem-solving skills. Barry’s quirky approach to design inspires audiences to embrace curiosity and unconventional ideas. With a background in engineering and product design and a passion for immersive experiences, he challenges perceptions of what it means to innovate in a rapidly changing world. Barry received his PhD from MIT studying creativity, humor, and idea generation. \n\nThis talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

In this TEDx talk, Dr. Roy T. Williams explores how imagery, structure, and symbolism can unlock deeper understanding of Macbeth, turning passive reading into active exploration. Using visual charts, geometric structures, and the rhythms of Shakespeare’s text, this talk reveals how learners can develop agency in their own understanding of the play. By connecting traditional storytelling with dynamic, interactive visualizations, we bridge the gap between complexity and clarity, making Shakespeare’s tragedy more accessible than ever. Roy Williams is a practical theorist, media analyst, researcher, designer, gardener, and grandfather. His current projects include: developing a digital platform for exploring Shakespeare’s plays funded by a grant from the UK Arts Council, writing a family history focused on Colesberg titled “Die Towerberg se Dans,” and exploring ancestral restoration and the potential use of AI in a U-Lab project in the US.\n\nRoy has held senior academic and management positions in South Africa and the UK, including leading international development projects in several countries, some in collaboration with his late wife, Charl Walters. His executive roles have included CEO positions at the South African Broadcast Authority and the Sached Trust. Before retiring, Roy was a senior lecturer and researcher in the Department of Mathematics at the University of Portsmouth and across the university.

She begins by sharing the story of her grandfather, who bravely left India to pursue education in the United States—a decision that would ripple across generations and shape the trajectory of their family’s future. Through this poignant narrative, Eela highlights the sacrifices, struggles, and cultural resilience that have defined her family’s pursuit of knowledge and opportunity.\n\nEela then transitions to her own story, revealing how her grandfather’s legacy inspired her to build a company dedicated to making quality education accessible and affordable for Indian families. She addresses the pressing issue of rising education costs and the barriers that prevent many from achieving their academic dreams. With passion and insight, Eela demonstrates how one bold decision—whether it’s pursuing education against all odds or creating solutions to empower others—can create a lasting impact that transcends generations.\n\nThis talk is more than a personal story; it’s a powerful reminder that education is not just a degree or a stepping stone to a career—it is a legacy, a tool for freedom, and a catalyst for change. Eela’s message resonates with students, parents, and educators alike, urging us to reflect on the value of education and the role it plays in shaping lives and communities. Whether you’re navigating your own educational journey or supporting someone else’s, this talk will move you, inspire you, and remind you why we must never take the gift of education for granted. \n\nWatch now to be inspired by a story of courage, resilience, and the enduring power of education to transform lives across generations.

Viene presentata l'idea di \""rinascita\"" attraverso le sfide della vita, enfatizzando la necessità di uscire dalla propria zona di comfort e di abbracciare il rischio. L'autore condivide esperienze personali, come il coinvolgimento in una comunità religiosa e il lavoro nel quartiere di Danisinni a Palermo, dove è in corso un processo di rigenerazione urbana e sociale. Il focus è sull'equilibrio tra individualità e appartenenza, con un appello alla responsabilità collettiva e alla costruzione di comunità, simboleggiato dalla riapertura di un asilo locale, un passo verso una società più connessa e resiliente. La proposta finale è quella di superare la meritocrazia e la repressione, per promuovere un modello di comunità che valorizzi il dono, la solidarietà e l'amore. Padre Mauro Billetta è un frate cappuccino che opera nel quartiere Danisinni, a Palermo. Con il suo impegno religioso e sociale, si è dedicato alla cura delle persone più fragili e al recupero di spazi dimenticati, trasformandoli in luoghi di aggregazione e cultura. È conosciuto per il suo lavoro di inclusione sociale, cercando di rispondere ai bisogni della comunità locale, spesso attraverso progetti di solidarietà, educazione e riqualificazione urbana. Padre Mauro è anche impegnato in iniziative che favoriscono la crescita spirituale e il benessere collettivo, promuovendo il dialogo e l’integrazione tra le diverse realtà sociali di Palermo.

Is he doomed to depending on the kindness of strangers with pumps, or can Tom and Ray help cure him—or at least outfit him properly in case there is an explosion? Elsewhere, towing may be Dave's best option for transporting his beloved LeMans cross-country, because the car could fall off somewhere in Nebraska; Hanz can't decide if his wife's behavior at stoplights is utterly brilliant or utterly wacko; and Elizabeth may be asking too much from her Volvo. Is shutting down when she turns on the wipers really such a big deal? All this, plus a world record for parking in a small space and lots more, this week on The Best of Car Talk. \n_____________________\nI Just a BigFan of the Radio Show: The Best of Car Talk of NPR, so i created this channel youtube to reupload the radio file audio to the videos show to bring the informations of the show to the word, hope you like it\nIF has any problem about the Copyright, please contact me via: hope4tcnuk@gmail.com, I will delete it immediately and give you apologize.

Elsewhere, Fred doesn't know whether he should listen to his mechanic or his FSTB (Future Son-in-Law To Be) on how to start the Alfa that's been sitting in his garage for a year. Will siding with the mechanic doom Fred's daughter's marriage? Also, Steve's driver's window glare screen is now a stuck-in-the-door glare screen; Alison's Golf may be suffering from a \""cracked breather\"" and \""achin' plugs\""; and is Judy's Escort sending smoke signals that it won't make it to the moon?

He lost both, but he's kept his sense of humor, and is just kinda confused about why his Acura was the only car not towed from a party. Elsewhere, we thought nobody could be more devoted to an old heap than Tommy, until we met Lita who has written a poem about her Monte Carlo—we're just relieved she didn't try to rhyme anything with \""rust bucket.\"" Also, the holiday season brings good cheer and the annual squeak to Betsy's Town and Country; Kate's temporary fix for her frozen door locks is hilarious, and incredibly dangerous; and, did the hottest man in show business set Melinda's radio on fire?

Tom and Ray think Evelyn should just say a few kind words to the deity of her choice and move on, but will nonetheless offer a pseudo-scientific answer that's guaranteed to have MIT demanding its diplomas back. Elsewhere we find out if Bob's wife's car survived sucking a sock into the engine on Stump the Chumps; Gary's steering noise is scaring away his girlfriends; and did Barbara do more damage to her husband's truck, or her marriage, by driving a mile without any oil?

And why can't Bob stop laughing about his Geo's starting problem? Elsewhere, Alan's Lincoln is starting to sound eerily like his mother; Karen's Caravan's dashboard is telling her she's always going 120 miles per hour on an empty gas tank; Steph wants to tempt the Blowout Gods by removing his Miata's spare tire so he'll have more trunk space; and Ariel is thinking of buying her first car and is wondering what level of protection she needs to bring to the dealer.
