Known as the leading voice behind the viral phenomenon ""mewing,"" Dr. Mew is on a mission to uncover the root causes of crooked teeth, poor body posture, sleep apnea, ENT problem (otolaryngology) and a wide array of chronic health problems that stem from the way our faces grow ‚Äî or fail to grow ‚Äî in the modern world.\n\n500 years ago humans had excess space for 32 teeth but are now lucky to have space to fit 28, with wisdom teeth extraction becoming a right of passage, and premolar extractions all too common. The idea that this is genetic is on par with flat earthers. In the blink of an evolutionary eye, something very significant has occurred under our noses which we really don‚Äôt want to face up to.\n\nFollowing in the footsteps of his father, Dr. John Mew, Mike has challenged\nlong-standing assumptions in orthodontics, arguing that crooked teeth are not a genetic inevitability, but predominantly the result of environmental factors ‚Äî particularly poor oral posture and lifestyle changes in the modern era. His work connects the dots between facial structure, breathing, jaw function, posture, and overall health, making him a unique and sometimes controversial figure in both medical and wellness communities.\n\n============\nDR.

Their situation is not unique; many people experience similar feelings as they navigate their anxiety journey. I delve into the importance of trusting oneself, particularly in moments where decision-making feels paralyzing and anxiety seems insurmountable.\n\n\nStarting with the listener's expression of frustration‚Äîwaking up feeling exhausted and anxious, despite attempts to find calm through meditation‚ÄîI break down the message into manageable pieces. I underscore that a tough day, especially one fueled by a lack of restful sleep, is a reality many face. Instead of battling the day's challenges, I encourage embracing them, acknowledging fatigue while allowing anxiety to accompany us without letting it define our day.\n\n\nAs the listener grapples with racing thoughts about the future, I draw attention to the futility of trying to force these thoughts away. It‚Äôs more productive to foster curiosity about them and redirect focus to the present moment. By practicing mindfulness‚Äîwhether through a simple breath or by engaging with our surroundings‚Äîwe can ground ourselves in the now, freeing ourselves from the cyclic worry that anxiety often brings.\n\n\n#AnxietySupport, #SelfTrust, #Mindfulness, #StressRelief, #MentalWellness, #CopingSkills, #AnxietyHelp, #MindfulLiving, #PresentMoment, #EmotionalHealth, #PersonalGrowth, #InnerPeace, #HealingJourney, #SelfCare, #AnxietyRecovery, #Meditation, #Breathwork, #CognitiveBehavioralTherapy, #AcceptanceCommitmentTherapy, #WellbeingJourney, #AnxietyFree, #EmotionalRegulation, #OvercomingAnxiety, #AnxietyAwareness, #MentalHealthMatters #GinaRyan #ACP #AnxietyCoachesPodcast"", 'id': '05MlPdWfeAU', 'is_live': False, 'length': 1212, 'stats': {'comments': 2, 'likes': 14, 'views': 155}, 'tags': ['Anxiety', 'self-trust', 'mindfulness', 'stress relief', 'coping skills', 'mental health', 'decision making', 'self-blame', 'present moment', 'meditation', 'breathing exercises', 'emotional regulation', 'personal growth', 'well-being', 'inner peace', 'anxiety relief', 'healing', 'resilience', 'self-compassion', 'thought patterns', 'Gina Ryan', 'ACP', 'Anxiety Coaches Podcast', 'self-trust development', 'coping strategies', 'mindfulness practices', 'stress reduction techniques', 'effective decision-making', 'overcoming self-blame'], 'title': '1157 Listen In For A Coaching Session With Gina!

At the age of 11 Josh‚Äôs baseball coach, Rick Dunkerley, began teaching him how to make knives. In the very beginning, Josh would go to Rick‚Äôs shop where he learned to remove stock blades under the guidance of Rick.\n\nAbout a year later, Josh began putting a shop together at his home.  Josh‚Äôs Dad gave him room to work in his equipment shop, and at the age of 12 Josh joined the American Bladesmith Society. Over the next few years Josh began forging and honing his craft. Josh turned 14 at the Eugene Oregon knife show where he met other incredible knife makers, all too willing to share their talents and knowledge with Josh.   \n\nAt 15 years old, Josh passed the Journeyman Bladesmith test in Atlanta, Georgia at the Blade Show. Josh became the youngest bladesmith to ever pass this test.  The Journeyman test is a two-part process. A test blade must be forged and heat treated with the capabilities to chop a 1‚Äù rope in half, 2- 2x4‚Äôs in half and then still shave hair. Once the cutting tests are done the blade must be able to bend 90 degrees in a vise without breaking. After passing the performance test the maker must present 5 knives to a panel of Mastersmith Judges. Each knife is examined closely to ensure the knife is made to the highest standard of craftsmanship. At the Journeyman level a maker is not expected to show perfection but is expected to show a sufficient level of craftsmanship expected from a professional bladesmith.\n\nMontana Knife Company:  https://www.montanaknifecompany.com\n\nToday\'s Sponsors: \n\nPique:\n\nGet 20% off + a FREE rechargeable frother and glass beaker with your first purchase with my link https://Piquelife.com/CLEAREDHOT\n\nLMNT:\n\nhttps://www.drinklmnt.com/clearedhot\n\n\n[00:00:00] - Intro and Banter\n[00:02:48] - Media Exclusion\n[00:03:58] - Changing Political Definitions\n[00:05:06] - Trump Turns on His Base\n[00:06:57] - Lame-Duck Presidency Reflections\n[00:07:56] - ""Drain the Swamp"" Expectations\n[00:09:01] - Epstein Files Campaign Promise\n[00:10:00] - Modern Cover-Up Comparisons\n[00:15:08] - Releasing All Information Dilemma\n[00:17:32] - Social Circles vs. Crime Involvement\n[00:19:02] - Zero Tolerance for Abusers\n[00:21:00] - Money, Blackmail, and Intelligence Ties\n[00:23:28] - Threats Blocking Disclosure\n[00:24:53] - Personal Choices in Disclosure\n[00:27:01] - Broadsword vs. Scalpel Approach\n[00:29:59] - MKC Growth Story\n[00:35:06] - New Facility Construction\n[00:36:57] - Hiring Plans and Equipment List\n[00:38:56] - Heat-Treat Batch Failure\n[00:42:50] - Blade Lead-Time Explained\n[00:44:00] - German Grinder Price and Tariffs\n[00:46:55] - Uncertainty Halts Hiring and Spending\n[00:49:00] - Finished Goods vs. Equipment Tariffs\n[00:50:55] - Loss of U.S. Powder-Steel Production\n[00:53:45] - Crucible Acquisition and Tech Move\n[00:55:55] - Steel Tariff Impact\n[00:58:45] - Passing Costs to Customers\n[01:00:46] - Tiered Tariff Plan Proposal\n[01:03:33] - Government as Poor Steward of Money\n[01:05:04] - Apparel, Chemicals, and Reshoring\n[01:07:20] - Deficit Concerns and Legislation\n[01:12:11] - Power Grid Parts Sourced Overseas\n[01:14:53] - Transformer Vulnerability Scenario\n[01:17:10] - Belief in the American Dream\n[01:19:34] - Meeting Brandon: Marketing Partnership\n[01:23:28] - Black Rifle Coffee Shop at MKC\n[01:27:00] - Turkish Toilet-Paper Holder Regret\n[01:29:45] - Hidden Knives and Helicopter Hunts\n[01:31:30] - Call for Citizen Engagement\n[01:33:55] - Tax Boycott Thought Experiment\n[01:36:03] - Presidential Age Limits\n[01:38:32] - Airport Mask Memory\n[01:40:45] - Closing Remarks and Thanks', 'id': 't4QclLj3zkI', 'is_live': False, 'length': 6815, 'stats': {'comments': 35, 'likes': 173, 'views': 2090}, 'tags': [], 'title': 'Episode 397 - Josh Smith - Manufacturing, Tariffs, and Bringing Jobs back to the United States', 'transcript': None, 'youtubeVideoId': 't4QclLj3zkI'}, {'age_restricted': False, 'airDate': '20250721', 'categories': ['Entertainment'], 'description': 'Jimmy Hatch grew up in the mountains of Utah and joined the service on his seventeenth birthday. After serving four years in the US fleet, Hatch completed SEAL training with Class 164 in 1990, launching him into a twenty-two-year career with the SEAL teams that would take him across the world. \n\nDeployed many times, Hatch was involved in over 150 direct action missions in all the places you‚Äôve heard about and a few you haven‚Äôt. His military career ended in 2009, when he was severely injured on his final mission. His life was saved by his teammates and the working dog on his team, marking the beginning of a long and challenging recovery.\n\nFollowing eighteen surgeries, Hatch left the hospital facing a new battle with mental health struggles. Determined to find purpose beyond his own struggles, he founded Spike‚Äôs K9 Fund, a 501(c)(3) organization dedicated to the welfare of the nation‚Äôs working K9s, honoring the loyalty and courage of his own canine comrades. Hatch also co-authored Touching the Dragon: And Other Techniques for Surviving Life‚Äôs Wars, sharing insights on resilience and recovery. Jimmy has traveled far and wide, giving speeches on his experiences to help others prepare for when life gets tough.\n\nIn 2019, Hatch embarked on a new journey, studying the humanities at Yale University. He graduated in 2024. Now, he is working on a second book as he works part-time for Yale Admissions and serves as a lecturer at the Jackson School of Global Affairs.\n\nSpikes K9:  https://spikesk9fund.org/\n\n\nToday\'s Sponsors: \n\nMontana Knife Company: \n\nhttps://www.montanaknifecompany.com\n\nBrunt: \n\nFor a limited time, listeners get $10 off at BRUNT when you use code ""clearedhot"" at checkout.

He got the bug to start a company, and only lasted 2 years at school - before he ventured out on his own. Eventually, his company got acquired by Coinbase, which opened up a whole new world for him. Outside of tech, he is married with a 4 month old boy. He doesn't drink caffeine, but daily, enjoys a decaf cappuccino.\n\n\nIn December 2021, Jesse and his team were wondering in the desert for a while, trying to figure out what was next on-chain.

His kindness is expressed in more ways than simply the provision of wealth, health, and relationships. Some divine gifts are experiences we would never choose, but the Lord knows we need them in order to grow in faith, obedience, and perseverance. \n\nConsider these expressions of God‚Äôs goodness toward us: \n\n‚Ä¢ Loving Discipline. Since God‚Äôs love is unfailing, He corrects us when we need it. The process is painful, but the result is ‚Äúthe peaceful fruit of righteousness‚Äù (Heb. 12:11).\n\n‚Ä¢ Wise Limitations. With His perfect insight, the Lord lovingly withholds things that would be detrimental to us spiritually.\n\n‚Ä¢ Useful Suffering. God knows which refining experiences we need in order to become fruitful in His kingdom. What appears to us as a valley of hardship is His place of preparation for godliness and service.\n\nIt can be tempting to interpret God‚Äôs character on the basis of our circumstances. But when evidence compels us to doubt His goodness, it‚Äôs important to remember this: His gifts may come in a variety of shapes and sizes but are always beneficial. As Psalm 34:8 says, ‚ÄúO taste and see that the Lord is good.‚Äù\n #dailydevo #devotion', 'mediaType': 'image', 'mediaUrls': ['https://instagram.ffdo5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-15/522560629_18515263936040178_2780031374635465456_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e15_fr_p1080x1080_tt6&_nc_ht=instagram.ffdo5-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=106&_nc_oc=Q6cZ2QF6IEUAzPuDDMFPS_VdG72Nyo1L5fbD9soa1nfro7FT3a7zrHDyZ2NXRMzbhH5YJUk&_nc_ohc=jNcXInEl0NUQ7kNvwEc4dPD&_nc_gid=9wbUTdCPq0Q39OI6EA__wg&edm=AOQ1c0wBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfSePR8yTfGZPXfZtnRr7svCTZtJztlACWij2IkyUVBfhw&oe=6889A8E0&_nc_sid=8b3546'], 'postId': 'DMhz7oVuZ4K', 'postUrl': 'https://www.instagram.com/p/DMhz7oVuZ4K/', 'stats': {'comments': 10, 'likes': 445, 'views': 0}, 'timestamp': 1753441211}, {'caption': ""You‚Äôre never alone on life's journey.

And lastly watch Skyler try to scramble his way out of going to Disneyland with Alyssa, which if you don\'t remember, was his punishment for getting Lady May high at the beginning of the year!\n\nAs always we hope you enjoy!\n\nSUB TO OUR PATREON FOR BONUS AND BEHIND THE SCENES CONTENT!\nhttps://www.patreon.com/dropoutspod\n\nBUY OUR SICK FREAKING MERCH!\nhttps://www.shopdropouts.com\n\nKeep up with us!\nZach: https://www.instagram.com/zachjustice/\nJared: https://www.instagram.com/jarebearmusic/\nAlyssa: https://www.instagram.com/alyssaaliberti/\nSkyler: https://www.instagram.com/skylerhorne_/\n\nDM us with your questions, ideas, and videos!\nhttps://www.instagram.com/dropouts/\n\nor Email us!\ndropoutsadvice@gmail.com', 'id': 'A-xDR9CQs8U', 'is_live': False, 'length': 4216, 'stats': {'comments': 115, 'likes': 1460, 'views': 44934}, 'tags': ['The Dropouts', 'Dropout Podcast', 'dropoutspod', 'Zach Justice', 'Jared Bailey', 'Indiana Massara', 'Tarayummy', 'Cam Boys', 'Kian and JC', 'KNJ', 'Davidalvareezy'], 'title': 'We Were Attacked in Public! | Dropouts #264', 'transcript': None, 'youtubeVideoId': 'A-xDR9CQs8U'}, {'age_restricted': False, 'airDate': '20250708', 'categories': ['Entertainment'], 'description': 'It\'s the 21st century which means you NEED a website!

You can already tell from the title, but this was by far one of the coolest episodes and guests we\'ve had on this show. Joseph Gordon-Levitt has been in some of the most iconic film & tv projects for the last 30 years from 3rd Rock From the Sun and Angels in the Outfield, to 10 Things I Hate About You and 500 Days of Summer, to The Dark Knight Rises, Looper, Inception, and so much more it\'s too long to list. Obviously we talk about his incredible career, but he also shows a side of himself that might surprise you.\n\nFor the last several years, JGL has become increasingly invested in the rapid progression of technology and the future of the internet and humanity as a whole. He shares his perspective on the current state of the world, where he sees it going, and the efforts we can do now to make it even better. It\'s not like our typical conversations we have on this podcast, but it is very interesting and we highly encourage you to watch all the way through.

It was an alert ‚Äî but not one triggered by the military‚Äôs network of space-based sensors. Nor had it originated from the Space Force‚Äôs array of early-warning radar systems. Instead, the email appeared to have been forwarded to US Space Command by a tiny UN outfit in Vienna called the Office for Outer Space Affairs. The subject line read ‚ÄúPotential Asteroid Impact Notification‚Äù.\nUpon scanning the email, the operator, according to one ex-Space Force official, began to panic.

In today‚Äôs episode, I'm taking you on a journey through the fascinating world of the justice system with none other than Judge Simpson. This isn‚Äôt just an ordinary interview; it‚Äôs a deep dive into the mind of a judge who has dedicated over twenty years to understanding the law and the human behavior intertwined with it. Prepare to have your misconceptions challenged and your curiosity ignited!\n\nIn this enlightening discussion, we explore the essence of fairness in the courtroom. Judge Simpson shares his insights on what it means to be a successful judge. ‚ÄúSuccess is having people respect what I‚Äôve done,‚Äù he states, emphasizing the importance of being fair and kind. This perspective invites us to rethink our own definitions of success, not just in the courtroom but in life itself.\n\nWe tackle tough questions about the legal system, including the importance of transparency and the need for public understanding. Judge Simpson encourages everyone to visit a court and see the process firsthand. ‚ÄúI think everyone should go down to a court where they have the time and watch what happens,‚Äù he explains. This firsthand experience can dispel myths and foster respect for the legal system.\n\nThroughout the episode, we also discuss the complexities judges face when interpreting the law. Judge Simpson explains how human emotions and perceptions can influence cases. ‚ÄúTwo people can be looking at the same thing, and they see it differently,‚Äù he points out, illustrating the challenges of judging based on varying human experiences. This highlights the necessity of patience and understanding in the pursuit of justice.\n\nAs we dig deeper, we reflect on the role of defendants in court. Judge Simpson stresses the importance of allowing lawyers to speak on their behalf. ‚ÄúDefendants sometimes say too much when they start talking for themselves,‚Äù he notes, pointing out the pitfalls that can arise when emotions take over during legal proceedings. This insight is invaluable for anyone looking to understand the dynamics of a courtroom.\n\nWe also touch on the current climate surrounding judges and the respect they deserve. Judge Simpson expresses concern about the loss of respect for judicial figures and the crucial role they play in society. ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt like the law, then get the law changed,‚Äù he asserts, reminding us that the legal system is built on processes that allow for change and improvement.\n\nYou‚Äôll gain a fresh perspective on the justice system, the challenges judges face, and the importance of empathy and understanding in legal proceedings. Whether you‚Äôre a legal professional, a student, or simply someone interested in how justice is served, this conversation is for you!\n\nJoin us as we unpack these themes and more, giving you a glimpse into the life of a judge and the inner workings of the courtroom.

Later that same year, Turk made his recording debut with a cameo on Juvenile\'s solo debut, ‚ÄúSolja Rags.‚Äù Turk was billed as Young Turk, and welcomed into the newly formed Hot Boys (which also included Juvenile, B.G., and Lil Wayne), issuing ‚ÄúGet It How U Live!‚Äù in 1997 and ‚ÄúGuerilla Warfare‚Äù two years later.\nTurk continued to make cameos on other rapper\'s recordings, including Juvenile\'s big hits, ‚Äú400 Degreez‚Äù and ‚ÄúTha G-Code,‚Äù Lil Wayne\' ‚ÄúTha Block Is Hot‚Äù and ‚ÄúLights Out,‚Äù as well as B.G‚Äô. ‚ÄúIt\'s All on U, Vol. 1‚Äù and It\'s All on U, Vol. 2.‚Äù June 2001 saw the release of Turk\' solo debut, ‚ÄúYoung and Thuggin\',‚Äù on Universal Records. Turk recorded ‚ÄúUntamed Guerilla‚Äù for Cash Money as a follow-up, but soon jumped ship to Koch, following in the footsteps of B.G.\n‚ÄúUntamed Guerilla‚Äù remained unreleased and Turk made his Koch debut in 2003 with ‚ÄúRaw and Uncut.‚Äù In January 2004, Turk was in a Memphis, TN, apartment when narcotics officers and SWAT team members stormed in. According to police, Turk allegedly shot an officer during the drug raid; however, the rapper claimed he was hiding in the closet without a gun. At a preliminary hearing, a charge of first-degree attempted murder was reduced to second-degree attempted murder, but Turk was granted bail in the state but was not granted bail in the feds. While Turk was awaiting trial in prison as his third album, ‚ÄúPenitentiary Chances,‚Äù hit the streets in April 2004. After 8 years 8 months and 16 days Turk was released from prison on October 12, 2012, and has hit the ground running, doing interviews, making appearances, and getting in plenty of studio time. Turk has since started his own label ‚ÄúYNT Empire‚Äù with a lot of great up and coming artists on his roster. Turk\'s first project after his prison release, ""Blame It On The System"" let his fans know that he was back and the Game was about to change.\nAfter his release, Turk took 12 months of Domination to a whole new level.

Yes, it helps you combat stress by mobilizing energy to your brain and body, but it also is a key player in coordinating when you‚Äôre alert, and when you tend to be more relaxed, etc. \n-\nCortisol is somewhat unique because it undergoes what is called an endogenous circadian rhythm. Meaning, it undergoes fluctuations from very high to very low across the 24 hour cycle. But‚Ä¶ Cortisol is also released in response to things like stress, alarm clocks, even somewhat to a meal. Those increases in cortisol tend to be transient and ride atop the endogenous 24 hour rhythm.\n-\nYour SCN- a small cluster of neurons above the roof of your mouth coordinates the endogenous rhythm but remarkably, it can also learn to anticipate or what is called ‚Äúentrain‚Äù to regularly occurring cortisol stimulating events- like alarm clocks that always go off at the same time.\n-\nSo the simple answer to the question of why you awake up just before your alarm clock is ‚Äúcortisol‚Äù but that really doesn‚Äôt get to the mechanism, which is why it took me about 2 1/2 minutes to explain. \n-\nBiology is amazing. Just think about what‚Äôs required to coordinate these events among distant parts in the body and brain and trillions of cells‚Ä¶ incredible. \n-\nAlso, thanks to @chadwright278 for asking me to look into this mechanism. I‚Äôm only about a year late in answering!

Anyone dealing with a health challenge of any kind will also benefit from setting their cortisol rhythm correctly.\n-\nRegardless of when you wake up or go to sleep, the ideal pattern is relatively high cortisol in the 1-2hrs after waking and low in the 1-2 hours prior to sleep.\n-\nTo achieve that you want to do opposite things of the two ends of the day. Bright light, hydration, exercise, caffeine early in the day as soon as possible after waking. And then at night: dim lights, avoiding a bright short wavelength light (not just blue light), avoiding caffeine, etc. \n-\nI‚Äôll cover more specifics in an upcoming episode of the Huberman Lab podcast, but this post introduces you to the general contour of what is ideal for your mental health and physical health as it relates to cortisol patterns across the 24 hour cycle and what you can do to impose the best patterns.\n-\nAnd of course, nobody‚Äôs perfect about this stuff. Strive to do as well as you can most mornings and nights.

I WAS bloody young, I was 22 and didn‚Äôt even know who I really was, let alone share my life with someone. It WAS too soon. We really barely knew each other. We DID come from different worlds and we had to navigate the differences. And finally I did leave my family and was profoundly lonely. But the one thing he (and many others) didn‚Äôt account for was our willingness to work through it. And yes, I do mean work. It IS work to constantly communicate and check yourself. To compromise, and sacrifice. To say the hard thing.

In today‚Äôs deep dive, Tom tackles one of the hottest‚Äîand most misunderstood‚Äîtopics in urban life: rent control. As rents skyrocket in cities like New York and San Francisco, and an entire generation struggles under crushing debt and soaring housing costs, the call for rent control has become louder than ever. But Tom asks the hard question: does rent control actually make rents more affordable, or does it trigger a downward spiral of housing shortages, urban decay, and economic stagnation?\n\nDrawing lessons from around the world and diving into the history of rent control policies in cities like New York, Stockholm, Berlin, and San Francisco, Tom exposes the hidden costs and unintended consequences of top-down economic interventions. He argues that while rent control might sound like a lifeline for struggling renters, it often backfires‚Äîmaking things even worse by stifling new construction, deteriorating housing stock, and trapping communities in economic hardship.\n\nThrough compelling stories and insightful analysis, Tom explores why these policies persist, the powerful forces‚Äîlike NIMBYism and regulatory capture‚Äîkeeping housing scarce, and how cities like Houston and Tokyo buck the trend with market-driven solutions. Packed with examples, practical takeaways, and a passionate call for economic freedom, this episode is a must-listen for anyone trying to understand the real roots of the housing crisis‚Äîand what can actually be done to fix it.\n\nTune in, and let‚Äôs separate myth from reality on the future of affordable living!"", 'id': 'IBXrpyflEWw', 'is_live': False, 'length': 2757, 'stats': {'comments': 401, 'likes': 1130, 'views': 29316}, 'tags': ['rent control', 'housing crisis', 'student debt', 'millennials', 'Gen Z', 'affordable housing', 'urban decay', 'homelessness', 'San Francisco housing', 'New York City zoning', 'property values', 'command economy', 'free market', 'economic stagnation', 'economic freedom', 'government intervention', 'zoning regulations', 'housing supply', 'market forces', 'inflation', 'rent stabilization', 'housing shortages', 'real estate development', 'socialism', 'home ownership', 'economic inequality', 'regulation', 'construction boom'], 'title': 'The Elite plan to rob Millennials & Gen Z blind Plus How to Escape | Tom Bilyeu Deepdives', 'transcript': None, 'youtubeVideoId': 'IBXrpyflEWw'}, {'age_restricted': False, 'airDate': '20250717', 'categories': ['People & Blogs'], 'description': 'ButcherBox: $20 off and free bacon for life: https://butcherbox.com/impact \nAllio Capital: Macro investing for people who want to understand the big picture.

Professor Breslin is fully aware of the disruptive nature of Artificial Intelligence in the university classroom. Still, he decided to harness it for the good and encourage his students to use it responsibly to gather data essential to any possible new Constitution of the United States. Prairie Gunnels explained the methodology she used to give ChatGPT the information it needed to compose these draft constitutions. It turns out, for example, that on the whole, each generation wants to preserve the right to keep and bear arms. However, younger generations are much more comfortable with installing regulations to prevent mass shootings and mayhem. We discussed how to constitute a new generation of ‚Äúfounders,‚Äù provide them with the necessary information to draft a constitution, and then create a ratification system that is fair and representative.

Henry began his life as a shopkeeper but rose to become the governor of Virginia and one of the handful of most essential rabble-rousers in the American Revolution. Henry and Jefferson were frenemies; at one point, Jefferson (the Deist) said to his friend Madison, ‚ÄúWe must pray for Henry‚Äôs death.‚Äù This quip was likely a joke, but Jefferson was quite critical of Henry, and he never forgave him for initiating a legislative investigation into Jefferson‚Äôs conduct as the beleaguered wartime governor of Virginia. Henry refused to attend the Constitutional Convention in 1787 because, he said, ‚Äúhe smelt a rat.‚Äù He opposed ratification in Virginia, but when Jefferson and Madison were considering secession in 1798 and 1799, Henry declared to George Washington that the constitutional settlement must not be disturbed by the Jeffersonians.

First, TR and his sons Archie, age 19, Quentin, age 15, and their cousin Nicholas Roosevelt, age 20, rode through the Grand Canyon and up to the North Rim, where they hunted mountain lions. Then, they made an arduous horseback journey to Rainbow Bridge, the sacred site in the heart of Navajo country. Finally, they visited the Hopi world, where TR and his young companions observed the sacred snake dance and got into the underground kiva, where scores of rattlesnakes slithered around. Harvey Leake has dozens of family photographs of this 1913 Roosevelt adventure. It's a strenuous life story that could not possibly be connected to any other president of the United States.

This can create a viscous cycle that leads to people becoming sicker than ever before. \n\nGetting blood work can be important at times and you should always work with your doctor on what is best for you. But there are steps and tools you can put in place to protect your immune system before, during, and after getting blood drawn.

While everyone should have every right to be concerned about what goes on their food for many reasons, the truth and reality of what the food supply is laced with goes way beyond Apeel. What people really need to know is that this has been occurring for decades. Toxic synthetic waxes, toxic applications of ammonia, toxic mold inhibitors, toxic fungicides, toxic preservative agents and more are sprayed, laced, dipped and coated on produce and animal products. This has no connection to pesticides and herbicides sprayed on conventional and organic produce, instead, these are separate industrial entities for the most part. The question is, why are these industries doing this? The answer is, to try to keep produce and meat fresh for as long as possible so that growers, middle men, and grocery store chains feel warm, safe and fuzzy and not worried about the food quickly going bad. There is a deep, dark secret in the food industry that Medical Medium has tried to expose for years, and it‚Äôs the hundreds of millions of pounds of food wastage that could feed the world but instead it‚Äôs thrown in dumpsters. In this episode you will learn about this food wastage and what‚Äôs being placed on our food that makes Apeel look like an Appetizer compared to all of the food crimes occurring.\n\nIn this episode‚Ä¶\nLearn what kind of toxic coatings are on the food bought in the grocery stores.\nDiscover how Apeel is just one of many food coverings that are believed to protect fruits and vegetables so they have a longer shelf life.\nFind out about fungicides and how they are sprayed on produce and animal products to stop fungus from growing on the food.\nLearn about how produce is dipped in mold inhibitors to stop the skins of fruits from molding.\nDiscover the truth about produce rotting from the inside instead of outside because of the toxic preservative applications.\nSee how fresh produce served on cruise ships are laced and coated with food preservatives to prevent it from rotting too quickly.\nLearn the truth about millions of tons of food wastage a year that could be used to help starving people in the world.\nFind out why it‚Äôs so important to wash and rinse your food before preparing and cooking.\nDiscover the difference between growing your own food versus getting your food from other sources.\n\nAll this and more, tune in and don‚Äôt miss out on this important episode.

Methylene blue would be a wonderful addition in the healing world if it only offered something good, just one thing positive, if it offered just one little, helpful quality to contribute in the world of illness and healing, but unfortunately, it doesn‚Äôt, and never will. For one, methylene blue is a salt that is void of all salt, void of all electrolytes, but not just void of all electrolytes‚Ä¶it‚Äôs an electrolyte robber, taker, an electrolyte thief that, when enters the body, is far from a good thing for anyone who has a chronic illness or a neurological condition, vagus nerve problem or any issues at all with a sensitive central nervous system. That means that if someone has any kind of anxiety whatsoever, methylene blue will rob electrolytes that are critically needed for neurotransmitter function, which will then lead to worsened forms of anxiety. What does methylene blue possess? Nothing. It has no amino acids, no enzymes, no trace minerals, no macro minerals, no proteins, no nutrients, no phytochemical compounds, no antiviral compounds, no antibacterial compounds, no glucose, no vitamins, and the list goes on. Biohackers love methylene blue because it‚Äôs an easy sell to desperate people who are chronically ill and are on the search for the next possible breakthrough in health.

Guess what‚Äôs back‚Ä¶ urine therapy. It‚Äôs a trend that has come and gone for over 40 years in the alternative health movement. The sad part is, drinking your own pee never worked. One problem is that social media doctors and influencers still unfortunately don‚Äôt know why so many people are really sick and suffering. It‚Äôs just recently, in the last couple of years, that these health professionals and influencers have been getting some clues that all of these chronic illness symptoms are really neurological symptoms, not a lack of collagen or a lack of protein or because of too much omega 6‚Äôs. A wake up call came many years ago from the Medical Medium information, illuminating the true causes of chronic illness, such as Epstein Barr virus, other pathogens and toxic metals. News Flash! Urine Therapy does not fix it. This is an episode you don‚Äôt want to miss. It‚Äôs classic, timeless, extremely informative and another great way to learn how to protect yourself. It‚Äôs even advertiser-free and commercial-free listening.

Some aspects have improved, but for the most part it‚Äôs still the same old sea of confusion out there. Carb-free diets, milk cleanses, meat only diets, extreme water fasting, bone broth cleanses, intermittent fasting, eat-what-you-want diets, trendy supplements filled with natural flavors, or supplements that are just toxic in general...the list goes on and on. It‚Äôs a wonder how the chronically ill can find their way through it all. And then there‚Äôs the good ole Oxalate Theory that peaks its ugly head out every five years and torments the people who are already tormented by what ails them. There are a few reasons why oxalate fear is still here and it‚Äôs the same reasons so many other fads and trends of health are still here: it‚Äôs marketing, PR campaigns, shock and awe strategies based on fear, and to this day, no one really knows why people are really sick. Just say oxalates are the cause and the fear takes over; it‚Äôs an easy sell, but it‚Äôs not the reality. It‚Äôs still a world of guessing games out there. The health movement keeps reigniting and spreading oxalates over and over again. An unfounded theory that holds people with chronic illness back and places them in a fear-based mentality with food...this is a nightmare. And as far as the influencers and health professionals that keep talking up and spreading oxalate fear, let‚Äôs just say it‚Äôs truly sad in so many ways. The truth is almost every food has oxalates in it, including animal protein. The people screaming their heads off about oxalates are picking on a small list of fruits and veggies, and spinach takes the biggest hit. Meanwhile, spinach is a powerful healing leafy green for the chronically ill.\n\nIn this episode‚Ä¶\n\nDiscover why oxalate fear is a recycled health trend trap that diverts chronically ill people from effective healing paths.\n\nLearn how testing for oxalates is unreliable and lacks accuracy.\n\nFind out why the fear of oxalate-rich foods is unnecessary and harmful, and why foods like spinach, celery, and potatoes are demonized.\n\nLearn how kidney stones are not caused by oxalates and why that‚Äôs a flawed theory.\n\nDiscover the truth about viral infections and how they are the real cause of many chronic illnesses, not oxalates.\n\nFind out why the oxalate theory is recycled misinformation and how it resurfaces periodically, misleading new generations of health seekers.\n\nLearn how mainstream and alternative health practitioners can unintentionally spread misleading oxalate fears. Even well-meaning doctors and health coaches may unknowingly promote harmful ideas due to lack of experience with chronic illness.\n\nDiscover how Medical Medium tools (like celery juice and zinc) are real solutions and effective treatments for chronic conditions, as opposed to avoiding oxalates.\n\nAll this and more, tune in and don‚Äôt miss out on this important episode.

It‚Äôs a beautiful, magical thing that you‚Äôre doing, mama.\n\nBut also‚Ä¶. please don‚Äôt ever stop believing that you‚Äôre worthy of cup-filling. Or that you won‚Äôt ever have time for it again.\n\nRight now, it might not look like long epsom salt baths and leisurely walks. But it will again one day.\n\nAnd right now, it might feel way more important to chop up the 17th apple of the day.\n\nAnd that is so very okay, and sacred, and I see you.\n\nBut here‚Äôs what I want to say:\n\nDo your best to find ways to honour yourself, no matter how small.\n\nDrink your tea while it‚Äôs still (semi) hot.\n\nStand in the sun for a moment.\n\nClose your eyes and breathe, and feel your feet on the earth.\n\nBecause yes, you *can* pour from an empty cup‚Ä¶ but you‚Äôre allowed to refill it too‚Ä¶even if it‚Äôs just one drip at a time.\n\nAnd one day, the walks and baths will come back.\n\nBut until then, please don‚Äôt forget about you.\n\nBecause you matter too, mama.

Today, we\'re diving into the mind of business strategist extraordinaire, Chris Lee. Join host Mick Hunt as he unpacks Chris‚Äôs insights on the true essence of entrepreneurship, the critical role of business identity, and the paramount importance of culture in scaling successful businesses. Discover why your only competition is the pain you\'re solving and learn from Chris\'s unique experiences and game-changing strategies that have led him to impact billions. Buckle up for bold moves and raw insights in this unmissable conversation!\xa0\n \n\nTakeaways\n \n      \n  ‚Ä¢  Entrepreneurs have the power to change society through entrepreneurship by providing value and solving customer pain points.\n      \n  ‚Ä¢  One common mistake entrepreneurs make when scaling their businesses is working solely for money instead of focusing on their people and developing a strong company culture.\n      \n  ‚Ä¢  Charging more for products or services can lead to better customer experiences and higher profits, as long as the value provided justifies the price.\n      \n  ‚Ä¢  Creating a strong company culture is essential for success, and it can be achieved through a clear vision and mission, core values, and a focus on the whole human approach.\n       \n\nTop 3 Questions answered in the episode:\n \n      \n  1. Why is maintaining a business identity crucial for growth? \n           \n       ‚Ä¢  Chris emphasizes that businesses should focus on their unique identity and solving customer pain points, rather than trying to impress others or compete on price alone.\n            \n      \n  2. What are the common mistakes made by entrepreneurs in their growth journey? \n           \n       ‚Ä¢  Chris points out flaws such as prioritizing money over mission, neglecting employee development, and misusing profits for personal gain instead of reinvesting in the business.\n            \n      \n  3. How can a business effectively create and maintain a strong culture? \n           \n       ‚Ä¢  Chris highlights the importance of a designed culture, stressing a clear vision, mission, and core values actively practiced within the organization to ensure holistic employee development.\n            \n       \n\nSound Bites\n \n      \n  ‚Ä¢  ""Money chases value and entrepreneurs can change society through entrepreneurship.""\n      \n  ‚Ä¢  ""Charge more and provide more, either be the most expensive or the cheapest in the market.""\n      \n  ‚Ä¢  ""You are not in competition with anybody, your competition is the pain you are solving.""\n       \n\nConnect and Discover:\n \n\nLinkedIn:\xa0 linkedin.com/in/chris-lee-0b02722b\n \n\nInstagram:\xa0 Instagram.com/chrisleeqb\n \n\nFacebook:\xa0 facebook.com/chrisleeqb\n \n\nWebsite:\xa0 gonextlevelpros.com\n \n\nPodcast:\xa0https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/next-level-pros/id1687030281\n\n\nSee omnystudio.com/listener (https://omnystudio.com/listener)  for privacy information.', 'id': 'ye5363qls0A', 'is_live': False, 'length': 1677, 'stats': {'comments': None, 'likes': 1, 'views': 3117}, 'tags': ['mick unplugged', 'mick hunt', 'podcast'], 'title': 'Chris Lee | Mastering Business Identity and Growth', 'transcript': None, 'youtubeVideoId': 'ye5363qls0A'}]"

Roughly ten minutes later, the aircraft exploded in the air, killing all forty-four people onboard and scattering fiery debris across several miles of Colorado‚Äôs landscape.\n\nBy the early 1950s, air travel had become a popular means of travel for more and more Americans and, while air disasters weren‚Äôt unheard of, they nonetheless called into question the safety of traveling on a passenger flight. This time, however, investigators quickly determined that the explosion of flight 629 hadn‚Äôt been an accident; someone had intentionally sabotaged the flight with a suitcase bomb.\n\nThe explosion of United Airlines flight 629 marked the first time a passenger plane had been bombed in the United States, something few if any authorities ever thought would happen. In the event of an act of terror, an individual or group typically comes forward quickly to claim credit; however, in the case of flight 629, no one came forward and investigators were left to wonder, what possible reason could someone have for killing forty-four people with no obvious connection between them?\n\nThank you to the Incredible Dave White of Bring Me the Axe Podcast for research and Writing support!\n\nReferences\nAnastasio, Jeff. 2024.

The cause of the death for each was multiple stab wounds, and each victim had been disarticulated into eight pieces and placed in eight garbage bags before being deposited into trash barrels, where they were quickly discovered by a curious member of the public. \n\nDespite being discovered in different locations in different states, it didn‚Äôt take long for investigators to identify the similarities between the victims. They were all older men, single or separated, and all had been seen last around closing time at various New York gay bars. Moreover, the scant evidence found with each bottom appeared to connect the murders back to Staten Island, but told detectives nothing else about the killer. Then, in late 1993, the murders simply stopped and the case went cold.\n\nThe case of the man the press dubbed ‚ÄúThe Last Call Killer‚Äù sat on a shelf for nearly a decade before a team of cold case investigators picked it up again, determined to make progress. In the years that passed, advances in technology had allowed for the collection of previously unseen evidence, and it was thanks to that technology that the case was finally solved.\n\nThank you to the Incredible Dave White of Bring Me the Axe Podcast for research and Writing support!\n\nReferences\nBen-Ali, Russell, and William Rashbaum. 1993.

The group, led by singer/guitarist Kris Roe, gained widespread attention with 2003\'s So Long, Astoria, which included a cover of Don Henley\'s ""Boys of Summer,"" hitting number 24 on the Billboard 200. Despite line-up changes, Roe continues to lead the group, touring often and showcasing his knack for alt-rock hooks on albums like 2007\'s Welcome the Night and 2016\'s October in This Railroad Earth. #theataris #podcast #indierock \n\nFormed in 1996 in Anderson, Indiana, the Ataris originally began as the home demo-recording project of lead singer/guitarist Kristopher Roe and guitarist Jasin Thomason. The group were discovered a year later by Vandals founder Joe Escalante after songwriter Kris Roe met him at a concert. Impressed by his demo tape, Escalante asked Roe to put together a full band and record for his label, Kung-Fu Records. Roe then picked up and moved to California in search of bandmates (Thomason decided to stay in Indiana), and eventually added guitarist Marco Pe√±a, bassist Mike Davenport, and former Lagwagon drummer Derrick Plourde. Plourde was later replaced by new drummer Chris Knapp. \n\nWebsite https://www.TheAtarisBand.com https://www.Instagram.com#theataris \nhttps://www.Facebook.com/theataris\n\n\nAbout Music Matters with Darrell Craig Harris\n\nThe Music Matters Podcast is hosted by Darrell Craig Harris, a globally published music journalist, professional musician, and Getty Images photographer.

Dana, a mother, claims a therapist‚Äôs social justice stance deepened the rift with her daughter in just three sessions. Dr. Phil also speaks with Soad, a licensed therapist who openly promotes her conservative views and insists clients know where she stands before they begin. Megan, a clinical counselor, says cancel culture came for her after sharing her political beliefs online.

But this time, we kept it simple: a stroll through the neighborhood, sandals on, leash in hand, breeze on our backs.\n\nYou‚Äôll walk with me past chalk drawings and porch swings, tiny fairy gardens and overflowing hostas, and hear me wax poetic about rooflines, old roommates, lemon granita, and my dog‚Äôs pee-mail system. Along the way, we run into Clover and Crimson, Birdie and Crumb, and even chase down the ice cream truck for something sweet.\n\nAnd this one‚Äôs extra special‚Ä¶because some of you are in it.\nThis episode features voice cameos from real listeners, and I am so touched by the magic you brought to this world. Thank you for showing up with open hearts and great voices.\n\nNow streaming on Stories from the Village of Nothing Much ‚Äî our cozy, reflective daytime podcast.\nFeaturing the voices of:\n‚Äì Melissa Rose (@melissas.real.life) as Marmalade‚Äôs Mom\n‚Äì Freddie Bee (Facebook) as the Cool Aunt\n‚Äì Ricardo Ferreira (@ricardojufe) as Birdie‚Äôs Dad\n‚Äì Max Lederer (Facebook, via Holly Rose) as the Nephew\n‚Äì and our own Bob Wittersheim as the Ice Cream Man \n\nWant to be part of a future episode?

Whether your career feels stuck, your relationships feel off, or you‚Äôre just not where you thought you‚Äôd be by now. Jay reminds us that feeling stuck doesn't mean you've failed, but could be life giving you a moment to pause and reset. Jay explains that the way we experience reality depends on what we choose to focus on. When we're fixated on what's going wrong, we often miss the small signs that things are already starting to move forward.\n\nJay also challenges the idea that success is supposed to be linear or perfect. He reminds us that the people who seem ahead aren‚Äôt more talented, they just started sooner. Rather tha comparing ourselves to someone else‚Äôs timeline, Jay encourages us to focus on our own path and let go of the pressure to have it all figured out. Instead of trying to achieve something massive all at once, Jay encourages us to ‚Äúshrink the vision, save the dream,‚Äù and take small, consistent steps that compound into real transformation. He reminds us that a plateau isn‚Äôt a setback, it‚Äôs a season of quiet growth that often comes right before a breakthrough.\n\nIn this episode, you'll learn:\nHow to Break Mental Overload with Movement\nHow to Take Action Before You Feel Ready\nHow to Stop Waiting for the Perfect Time to Start\nHow to Reframe Feeling Stuck\nHow to Build Momentum with Tiny Steps\n\nNo matter where you are in your journey, remember this: you‚Äôre not behind, you‚Äôre not broken, and you haven‚Äôt missed your chance.

Karan is an award-winning director, producer, screenwriter, and television host, best known for blockbuster films such as Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham, and My Name is Khan. As the head of Dharma Productions, he has launched the careers of many of Bollywood‚Äôs biggest stars and has consistently pushed the boundaries of mainstream Indian cinema. \n\nKaran shares the defining moments that shaped his path, from a powerful heart-to-heart with his mother to the encouragement of mentors like Aditya Chopra and Shah Rukh Khan, who saw in him the makings of a filmmaker before he could see it in himself. Karan recounts the difficult years of watching his father face failure in the film industry, and how that pain became fuel for his own success.\n\nAs the conversation with Jay deepens, Karan opens up about parenting, vulnerability, and the anxiety he has faced, even amidst professional triumph. As a single father to twins and a devoted son to his aging mother, he speaks of the emotional complexities of holding it all together while remaining grounded in purpose. Karan‚Äôs belief in karma, his rejection of ego, and his evolving spirituality show a man who has done the inner work to arrive at self-acceptance. \n\nIn this interview, you'll learn:\nHow to Find Belonging Without Changing Who You Are\nHow to Follow Your Instincts (Even When They Scare You)\nHow to Build Confidence Through Self-Expression\nHow to Use Failure as a Foundation for Growth\nHow to Lead with Kindness in a Competitive World\n\nGrowth is messy, finding your purpose takes time, and healing is never linear.

Giles is a professor at the University of Cambridge, specializing in the study of how genes influence appetite and body weight. He is the author of Gene Eating and Why Calories Don‚Äôt Count, both of which challenge conventional diet myths through the lens of cutting-edge science. Giles is also a science communicator and host of the podcast Dr. Giles Yeo Chews the Fat, where he breaks down complex nutritional concepts with clarity and humor.\n\nJay begins by asking the question on everyone‚Äôs mind‚Äîdo calories really count? Giles, with a calm and science-grounded approach, unpacks why the answer isn‚Äôt so simple. While calorie counting has become a cornerstone of dieting, he explains that the way our bodies extract and process calories depends heavily on the quality of the food, not just the number printed on a label. \n\nGiles shares how our genetic makeup influences hunger, satiety, and fat storage in ways that most diet plans fail to consider. Jay and Giles explore the emotional and social layers of eating, diving into how cultural conditioning, access to healthy food, and even marketing affect our food choices. They also examine why it's harder for some people to lose weight than others‚Äînot because of laziness or lack of willpower, but because their biology is wired differently. Giles challenges the shame-based narratives around body weight and reframes the discussion around health, sustainability, and self-awareness. \n\nIn this interview, you'll learn:\nHow to Eat for Quality, Not Just Calories\nHow to Read Food Labels the Right Way\nHow to Choose Protein, Fiber, and Sugar Wisely\nHow to Spot Diet Myths That Don‚Äôt Serve You\nHow to Lose Weight Without Obsessing Over Numbers\nHow to Understand Your Body‚Äôs Unique Metabolism\nHow to Manage Cravings with a Plan, Not Willpower\n\nYou don‚Äôt need to follow a strict diet or obsess over every calorie to feel better in your body.

His neuroscience-based approach to peace continues to inspire, and it was a privilege to share his story with our audience.\n\nThe Davey Awards celebrate the ""Davids"" of creativity‚Äîthose who, like David in the classic story of David and Goliath, defeat larger giants with big ideas and innovation rather than vast resources. It is the largest and most prestigious awards competition honoring small agencies, creative teams, and individuals making a difference with their impactful work. Judged by members of the Academy of Interactive and Visual Arts (AIVA), this award recognizes excellence in creativity from organizations that drive meaningful change. With over 4,000 entries each year, winning a Gold Medal is a testament to the impact we‚Äôre making at Passion Struck.\n\nAt Passion Struck, our mission is crystal clear: we‚Äôre here to harness the transformative power of intentionality. Our vision is a world where every individual not only lives more profoundly but also evolves into the best possible version of themselves. This award is a reflection of that mission, reminding us that stories of empathy and transformation truly matter.\n\nI want to express my heartfelt thanks to everyone who has supported us on this journey.

Discover how Jeff\'s early escape into Japanese media like Godzilla laid the foundation for his revolutionary approach to creating interconnected story worlds across multiple platforms.\n\nJeff reveals the shift from the traditional hero\'s journey to what he calls ""collective journey narratives"" - a storytelling model designed for our interconnected world.

We explore how Navy SEALs develop mental toughness, make decisive decisions under extreme pressure, and leverage their innate human capabilities to excel in chaotic environments.\nRich shares practical strategies to:\n\n- Transform uncertain moments into opportunities\n- Tap into your body\'s natural performance engine during difficult challenges\n- Maintain composure under pressure\n- Improve performance when stakes are highest\n- Understand your ""raw self"" to determine optimal actions in any scenario\n- Avoid the traps causing 95% of teams to underperform\n- Build the four domains of trust essential to high-performing teams\n\nWhether facing uncertainty in your personal or professional life, this conversation provides actionable insights to develop the mindset of an elite operator.\nAs Simon Sinek says about Rich\'s work: ""Easy to understand and simple to implement, Masters of Uncertainty is essential for any person or team that wants to operate even better than they do now.""\n\nAs Andrew Huberman writes in the foreword to Rich\'s latest book, and the focal point of today\'s podcast, Masters of Uncertainty: ""This book is a practical guide for how to wake up and be the most effective version of yourself, how to bring that to all your life\'s challenges, and (most importantly) how to perpetually bounce upward and forward when pushed back or under pressure... and in so doing, exceed your previous self and performance‚Äîover and over and over.""\n\n""People like Rich Diviney are rare: because of what they know, for what they have proved capable of doing, and for their ability to teach it to others...

With 30+ years of experience developing IPs like Five Nights at Freddy\'s, Twilight Saga, and Angry Birds, Russell provides unprecedented insights into how gaming communities are transforming Hollywood and gaming\'s approach to storytelling, merchandising and entertainment.\n\n""When I started in the business, there were the five families, Warner\'s, Disney, Universal, Sony, and Paramount, and they were generally the gatekeepers of the big IPs,"" Russell explains. He reveals the strategies behind turning Five Nights at Freddy\'s from an indie game to a global phenomenon through community cultivation: ""The virality of these jump scares and watching people play this game introduced this property to a massive social audience across YouTube, across Instagram... you didn\'t have to play the game to get excited about Five Nights at Freddy\'s.""\n\nRussell also shares candid stories about working with industry legends: ""If you ask me what I love about my job, as much as I love movies, as much as I love video games, the people I\'ve had the pleasure to work with, Steven Spielberg, Sean Levy, Guillermo del Toro, like some of the coolest storytellers and filmmakers..."" His insights on what makes an IP truly transferable are invaluable: ""If you look at what works in horror, it\'s iconic. It\'s Freddie, Jason, Michael Myers in the film business. In gaming, Five Nights at Freddy\'s and Poppy and Bendy... Iconic characters that translate multi-directionally.""\n\nWhether you\'re a creator looking to build your own IP, a gaming enthusiast curious about how your favourite games become movies, or an entrepreneur interested in transmedia business models, this episode offers invaluable wisdom on navigating today\'s rapidly evolving entertainment landscape.\n\nTimestamps:\n00:00 Introduction to Russell Binder and Striker Entertainment\n05:32 The Twilight Saga \n18:17 Transitioning to Video Games: Angry Birds and Five Nights at Freddy\'s\n25:43 Future of Transmedia and Cross-Platform Content\n34:27 The Challenges of Transmedia Projects\n34:54 Disney\'s Transmedia Mastery\n35:17 Amazon\'s Potential in Transmedia\n36:47 The Evolution of Gaming and Hollywood\n37:29 Criteria for Successful Transmedia Ventures\n40:15 High on Life: A Transmedia Success Story\n41:36 The Future of Transmedia Adaptations\n51:09: Working with Steven Spielberg \n59:42 The Future of Transmedia and Entertainment\n\nGuest Biography:\nRussell Binder is the founder of Stryker Entertainment, an IP accelerator specialising in transmedia development, licensing, and production.

Responsible for the God of War franchise -- and, other than Kinetica early in the PS2 era, only the God of War franchise -- there was some excitement building about what was next. But what if it's just more God of War... at least kinda? New rumors indicate that Santa Monica is working on something more familiar than we might have hoped, and from our perspective, that can only mean one thing. We discuss. Plus: Sucker Punch expresses interest in returning to Infamous, Ghost of Yotei gets special edition PS5 hardware and a DualSense, HBO's second season of The Last of Us earns a ton of Emmy nominations, concept art for Deviation's cancelled PlayStation exclusive emerges, Dragon Quest VII is apparently being remade at Square Enix, and more. Then: Listener inquiries! With the demise of Xbox's Turn 10 Studio, is it time for PlayStation to port Gran Turismo to its rival's machine?

Despite what many will try and say to downplay this, there is a strong chance that Fallout 5 goes beyond the borders of Bethesda for the first time since 2010. Considering it's a mainline entry, this is a massive shakeup. It gets even more dicey when Obsidian Entertainment gets taken off the board. So, who makes a new Fallout game? The 76 team? InXile? Larian? Dare we say, a new studio? Oh, boy. Each choice outside of the obvious like Larian or InXile has their caveats. So, let's get into the thick of the future of the Bethesda's valuable post-apocalyptic IP.\n\nGet early access to Defining Duke and all Last Stand Media shows at  https://www.patreon.com/LastStandMedia\n\nGet some Defining Duke merch! https://laststandmedia.store/\n\n0:00:00 - Intro/ Health Is Wealth\n1:08:15 - Arkane Lyon is safe for now\n1:10:18 - Zenimax hasn't seen layoffs yet\n1:13:52 - Rare has commented on the layoffs for the first time\n1:18:24 - Guitar Hero easter egg in Tony Hawk\n1:22:10 - Tony Hawk Pro Skater 3 + 4 is fully on the disc\n1:23:51 - Forza Horizon 5 sold 2 million copies on PlayStation 5\n1:25:52 - Fallout 76 is getting TV show content\n1:28:16 - Oblivion Remastered gets a crucial patch‚Ä¶ and a physical edition?!\n1:32:24 - Jez Corden on Starfield‚Äôs next DLC\n1:37:00 - The Alters has sold 280K copies\n1:38:49 - Ken Levine on Judas\n1:40:35 - Xbox is paying how much for Game Pass deals?!\n1:43:49 - Halo 1 Remake rumors\n1:54:05 - What We‚Äôre Playing\n2:20:40 - Fallout 5 has been greenlit\n2:52:08 - The Xbox Ally will be $1,000?\n3:01:19 - King is replacing workers with AI\n3:12:49 - Coming soon to Xbox Game Pass\n3:18:01 - Game Pass Pick Of The Week"", 'id': 'YL2GHwYzoVg', 'is_live': False, 'length': 12449, 'stats': {'comments': 186, 'likes': 371, 'views': 13178}, 'tags': [], 'title': ""We're FINALLY Getting Fallout 5...

And yet, there are things we don't understand about it. Some of these puzzles are relatively well-known, while others are less celebrated. David Tong joins us to talk about some of the more interesting and perplexing aspects of quantum field theory. He also discusses his new project to write a series of textbooks covering (all?) important topics in theoretical physics. To date, these include Classical Mechanics, Quantum Mechanics, Fluid Mechanics, and Electromagnetism.\n\nDavid Tong received his Ph.D. in theoretical physics from Swansea University. He is currently a professor of Theoretical Physics in the Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics at the University of Cambridge. He is a winner of the Adams Prize and a Simons Investigator. In addition to his books, he has written many freely-available sets of lecture notes on topics in physics.\n\nMindscape Podcast playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrxfgDEc2NxY_fRExpDXr87tzRbPCaA5x\nSean Carroll channel: https://www.youtube.com/c/seancarroll\n\n#podcast #ideas #science #philosophy #culture"", 'id': '0RhiYYk784w', 'is_live': False, 'length': 4763, 'stats': {'comments': 96, 'likes': 700, 'views': 25407}, 'tags': [], 'title': 'Mindscape 321 | David Tong on Open Questions in Quantum Field Theory', 'transcript': None, 'youtubeVideoId': '0RhiYYk784w'}, {'age_restricted': False, 'airDate': '20250721', 'categories': ['Science & Technology'], 'description': 'Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/seanmcarroll\nBlog post with audio player, show notes, and transcript: https://www.preposterousuniverse.com/podcast/2025/07/21/322-philip-pettit-on-language-agency-politics-and-freedom/\n\nWhen we think of the capacities that distinguish humans from other species, we generally turn to intelligence and its byproducts, including our technological prowess. But our intelligence is highly connected to our ability to use language, which is in turn closely related to our capacities as social creatures. Philosopher Philip Pettit would encourage us to think of those social capacities, as enabled by language, as the primary locus of what makes humans different, as discussed in his new book When Minds Converse: A Social Genealogy of the Human Soul. And that linguistic aptitude helps us understand the nature of agency, responsibility, and freedom.\n\nPhilip Pettit received his Ph.D. in philosophy from University College Belfast. He is currently Laurance S. Rockefeller University Professor of Human Values at Princeton University and Distinguished University Professor of Philosophy at Australian National University. He is a Fellow of the Academy of Social Sciences in Australia, the Australian Academy of the Humanities, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the Guggenheim Foundation, among other honors.\n\nMindscape Podcast playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrxfgDEc2NxY_fRExpDXr87tzRbPCaA5x\nSean Carroll channel: https://www.youtube.com/c/seancarroll\n\n#podcast #ideas #science #philosophy #culture', 'id': 'eS2tJBVBuo4', 'is_live': False, 'length': 4847, 'stats': {'comments': 22, 'likes': 174, 'views': 6071}, 'tags': [], 'title': 'Mindscape 322 | Philip Pettit on Language, Agency, Politics, and Freedom', 'transcript': None, 'youtubeVideoId': 'eS2tJBVBuo4'}, {'age_restricted': False, 'airDate': '20250707', 'categories': ['Science & Technology'], 'description': 'Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/seanmcarroll\nBlog post with audio player, show notes, and transcript: https://www.preposterousuniverse.com/podcast/2025/07/07/ama-july-2025/\n\nWelcome to the July 2025 Ask Me Anything episode of Mindscape!

According to our best current model, it will end up looking simple once again: cold, dark, empty. It's in between -- now, roughly speaking -- that things look complex. I have been working to understand the stages by which complexity comes into existence, thrives, and eventually disappears.

But in the original quote, Alfred North Whitehead was more careful: he limited his characterization to ""the European philosophical tradition."" There are other traditions, both ancient and ongoing: Chinese philosophy, Indian philosophy, Africana philosophy, and various indigenous philosophies. For the most part, these do not get nearly as much attention in European and American schools as the European tradition does. Bryan Van Norden argues for expanding philosophy\'s geographical scope, to the benefit of philosophy in general.\n\nBryan Van Norden received his Ph.D. in philosophy from Stanford University.

Here‚Äôs what I would tell single self: \n\n1) Never beg someone to stay. Why would you want to be with someone who doesn‚Äôt want to be with you? You deserve so much more than that. \n\n2) If you come home from a date saying, ‚ÄúI think I‚Äôm in love,‚Äù run. The best connections and healthiest relationships grow overtime. If you‚Äôre all in on someone after one date, you‚Äôre creating a fantasy version of them in your head that doesn‚Äôt exist in reality. They won‚Äôt live up to that version you‚Äôve invented of them, and you‚Äôll be so focused on needing them to want you back, that you won‚Äôt actually be your whole authentic self. \n\n3) You did nothing wrong by asking to be treated right.\n\n4) The hardest conversations are the most important ones to have. Take a deep breath, have 20 seconds of insane courage, and say what you need to say. \n\n5) Try your best not to future trip. If they‚Äôre going to be in your future, they‚Äôll be in your future. Picturing your future with someone is only going to make it harder to walk away, even if they suck. \n\n6) Don‚Äôt date potential, date the person.\n\n7) Stop trying to fix people. That‚Äôs not your job!\n\n8) Know your worth and don‚Äôt forget it. If someone doesn‚Äôt like you for you, that‚Äôs their loss. There‚Äôs someone out there who won‚Äôt be able to imagine their life without you.\n\n9) It‚Äôs not all about you. What someone does and says says more about them than about you. So just because someone doesn‚Äôt want to be with you or doesn‚Äôt want something serious, that doesn‚Äôt mean something is wrong with you. It just means they‚Äôre not your person. \n\n10)Have fun with it. Dating is freaking awesome. When else in your life can you spend your nights going to different bars, restaurants, coffee shops, and experiences with the goal of getting to know someone? You‚Äôll miss it one day. \n\nFollow along and check out my podcast Seeing Other People for more realistic dating advice! \n\nxx\nIlana \n\n#dating #datingadvice #single #lifelessons #anxiety #therapy #reflection #hinge #attachment', 'mediaType': 'video', 'mediaUrls': ['https://instagram.fmex36-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-15/491422002_981323263850958_7943791204348739492_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e15_tt6&_nc_ht=instagram.fmex36-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=106&_nc_oc=Q6cZ2QEKnGY92leSysI-cpkoksUHRrxWo9iorIx79ZHbJr-bGNIwUWzlSqvMWYOsHZlKyaE&_nc_ohc=zZ4fEkpI3MkQ7kNvwFG2EXo&_nc_gid=91mme2UAo4Jf9xtsMTHujw&edm=AOQ1c0wBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfSdQjWdcndYS11RSiZULEjfOIVAMK1gUkjiDVWUEduEIQ&oe=6889ADC0&_nc_sid=8b3546'], 'postId': 'C48XYBJsxmq', 'postUrl': 'https://www.instagram.com/p/C48XYBJsxmq/', 'stats': {'comments': 60, 'likes': 4934, 'views': 132153}, 'timestamp': 1711383159}, {'caption': 'Two and a half years ago, I lost my job and decided to pursue my dream of creating a podcast and community that helps people feel less alone in their dating lives.

It‚Äôs fast. It‚Äôs fun. And it‚Äôs got a little attitude. \u2060\n\u2060\nThe brainchild of Slate‚Äôs Dan Kois, built by a team of in-house developers and designers, Pears gives you a fresh grid of letters every day. Your task is simply to make as many words as you can with those letters. Once you enter four words, you‚Äôll unlock a special PEAR of letters. Find one word that uses that ‚Äúpear.‚Äù You only get one shot, so make it count. The longer the word, the higher the score.\u2060\n\u2060\nPears is about creating words, building runs, and, let‚Äôs be honest, trying to beat your friends. It‚Äôs wordplay for people who know their way around a dictionary and the internet. Pears welcomes words like shizzle, twink, ballgag, kiki, and more. If it‚Äôs part of the culture, it just might be in the game.\u2060\n\u2060\nSmart, snackable, and slightly unhinged, Pears is the perfect puzzle fix. And in keeping with Slate tradition, it speaks to both your SAT score and your group chat history. New games drop every weekday at lunchtime, Eastern time.

Common SSRIs include Prozac, Lexapro, and Zoloft, and they‚Äôre the most widely prescribed form of antidepressant in the U.S. According to the Cleveland Clinic, more than 1 in 10 Americans take some kind of antidepressant.\u2060\n\u2060\nOf the 10 panelists, only one‚Äîthe sole specialist in maternal mood disorders at the event‚Äîargued for SSRIs‚Äô safety and value. The others insisted, with just as much of a sense of authority and certainty, that the medications were ineffective and that they caused miscarriages, hemorrhaging, autism, ADHD, cardiac birth defects, fetal alcohol syndrome, and other frightening outcomes. üîó in bio for the full story.', 'mediaType': 'image', 'mediaUrls': ['https://instagram.fmex27-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-15/524198351_18522001354002311_1673114369895496261_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e15_fr_p1080x1080_tt6&_nc_ht=instagram.fmex27-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=111&_nc_oc=Q6cZ2QGPkdh78IoshuThR7hEMDuSGPO1mW97GbrpVOU-uzJmhEqwKhm5FUDN2gXcWzpIQwE&_nc_ohc=06fO6tvlQhgQ7kNvwEWEQhs&_nc_gid=5BVkYAZxItlC_iWFR1XXKg&edm=AOQ1c0wBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfTlPdu3Edhcw1fdmnB9imt8kmR5H1MDzoRCpVDBqLbX6Q&oe=6889A500&_nc_sid=8b3546'], 'postId': 'DMiYiuIs_X0', 'postUrl': 'https://www.instagram.com/p/DMiYiuIs_X0/', 'stats': {'comments': 1, 'likes': 31, 'views': 0}, 'timestamp': 1753460413}, {'caption': 'The Supreme Court expanded Donald Trump‚Äôs power yet again on Wednesday, granting him the authority to fire Democratic members of the Consumer Product Safety Commission in direct violation of federal law. \u2060\n\u2060\nOver the liberal justices‚Äô dissent, the conservative supermajority greenlit the first step of Trump‚Äôs systematic destruction of the agency‚Äîa plan that collides with many other federal statutes. The court‚Äôs action imperils the CPSC‚Äôs ability to ban products that may maim or kill consumers, including children, giving corporations freer rein to flood the market with dangerous goods. And it hands the president even more leeway to restructure the federal government in ways that hurt regular people, reward the wealthy, and contradict Congress‚Äô direct commands.\u2060\n\u2060\nWhat‚Äôs perhaps most galling about Wednesday‚Äôs decision, aside from the fact that it makes us all less safe, is SCOTUS‚Äôs reprimand of lower courts that try to stop Trump‚Äôs abuses of power. The majority scolded these courts for failing to interpret the smoke signals it has sent up on the shadow docket and, instead, daring to enforce existing precedent that limits executive authority.

In this episode, your favorite duo ‚Äî Max Burley and Yuban Whakinov ‚Äî serve up their weirdest, wildest takes yet on everything from aging like expired milk to fighting spiders mid-snack to navigating casino bathrooms with dignity (spoiler: they didn‚Äôt).\n\nThis episode is an all-you-can-laugh buffet of fast food obsessions, celebrity gossip, awkward family moments, and deep fried self-awareness. One second we‚Äôre talking about how aging makes you suspicious of stairs, and the next we're questioning our life choices in a Taco Bell drive-thru.\n\nüï∫ Topics Covered:\nAging Woes: From popping knees to random hairs growing in weird places, Max and Yuban get real about what it‚Äôs like when your body starts filing complaints against you.\n\nCasino Adventures: Big wins, bigger losses, and a buffet that made them question their cholesterol and life decisions.\n\nFood Cravings & Fast Food Philosophy: Can you bond over a McGriddle at 3 a.m.? Yes. Yes, you can.\n\nSpider Surprise: A truly horrifying snacktime story involving an unexpected 8-legged guest. #traumatized\n\nWeight Loss & Life Changes: Sometimes it takes a wake-up call (or a Taco Bell mirror) to make a change.\n\nSocial Media & Body Image: How TikTok filters, celeb scandals, and online weirdos warp how we see ourselves and each other.\n\nOnline Communities & Odd Interests: Ever joined a Discord just to talk about cheese?

This week, Beard Laws and his daughters share their adventures as a softball family, review Crumble Cookies like true dessert detectives, and drop one of our funniest podcast moments yet. If you're a fan of minor league baseball, local festivals, or just love a good laugh with your kids ‚Äî this one's for you.\n\nThis one‚Äôs got it all ‚Äî we‚Äôre talking swimming gone wrong (thanks, bees üêù), turf field softball game shenanigans, a trip to a Syracuse Mets baseball game, music-filled festival vibes, and yes‚Ä¶ Crumble Cookies so good they made us question our loyalty to all other desserts. Oh, and did we mention our new favorite segment? Fridge Detectives returns ‚Äî where we try to guess whose fridge we‚Äôre peeking into based solely on the mysterious and sometimes downright disturbing contents inside.\n\nüèä\u200d‚ôÇÔ∏è SWIMMING ADVENTURES & BEE STINGS\nWhat starts as a peaceful day by the water quickly turns into an unexpected nature encounter, proving once again that family fun sometimes bites‚Ä¶ or stings. We talk about the importance of sunscreen, hydration, and how swimming can go from chill to chaos real fast ‚Äî especially when bees are involved.\n\nü•é SOFTBALL ON TURF\nIf you‚Äôve never played or watched softball on a turf field, let us tell you ‚Äî it‚Äôs a whole different beast. We break down how it changes the game (spoiler: the ball bounces like it‚Äôs caffeinated), how hot turf can get, and why sliding on it is a questionable life choice. Plus, hear about the best post-game snacks and how to survive youth sports as a parent without losing your voice or your mind.\n\n‚öæ SYRACUSE METS FAMILY NIGHT\nThe crew took a trip to see the Syracuse Mets play, and it was a home run for family bonding. We share our favorite moments from the game ‚Äî from epic plays to overpriced stadium snacks ‚Äî and talk about why minor league baseball is one of the best bang-for-your-buck family nights around. Affordable tickets, great seats, kid-friendly vibes, and of course, ice cream in baseball helmets üç¶‚öæ ‚Äî what more could you want?\n\nüé™ FESTIVAL FUN & LOCAL MUSIC\nSmall town festivals are the heart of summer. We talk food trucks, local musicians, balloon animals gone wrong, and the kind of random fairground weirdness you only get once a year. Whether you go for the fried dough, the fireworks, or the people-watching, there‚Äôs something about these local events that just screams ‚Äúsummer.‚Äù (Sometimes literally.)\n\nüç™ CRUMBLE COOKIES & JERSEY MIKE‚ÄôS\nAh yes, the sweet, sweet joy of Crumble Cookies ‚Äî that one place where your diet goes to die and your taste buds throw a party. We dive into our favorite flavors, how they stack up against homemade, and whether Crumble is worth the hype. Bonus: A little Jersey Mike‚Äôs sandwich love too because‚Ä¶ balance, right?\n\nüßä FRIDGE DETECTIVES: WHOSE FRIDGE IS THIS?!\nPossibly our most chaotic and fun segment yet. We dig into anonymous fridge photos and try to guess the owners based on the contents. Is this a college bachelor‚Äôs fridge or a family of seven? Is that a bottle of kombucha or expired pickle juice? Let‚Äôs just say some of these fridges made us laugh‚Ä¶ and some made us worry. This segment proves that your fridge tells your story, and sometimes that story is: ‚ÄúI eat string cheese and regret.‚Äù üòÇ\n\nüëÄ COMMON THEMES & TAKEAWAYS:\nFamily time matters. Even the chaotic moments turn into memories.\n\nSwimming can lead to the wildest surprises.\n\nSoftball on turf is a different kind of sweaty.\n\nMinor league baseball = big-time fun.\n\nFood brings people together. Crumble brings people back.\n\nFestivals connect you with your community (and fried Oreos).\n\nYour fridge reveals more than you think.\n\nKids say the funniest things when you‚Äôre recording.\n\nFuture podcast guests?

Drawing from Marcus' experiences leading Rome through war and plague, I explore how his preoccupation with death wasn‚Äôt morbid, but practical‚Äîan attempt to remain aligned with Nature and his duty within the Cosmopolis. Death, like birth, is part of the universal order, and Stoicism teaches us that fearing it contradicts the very reason and nature we‚Äôre trying to live in accordance with.\n\nI also answer a listener question about the tension between patience and passivity. When someone wrongs us repeatedly, how do we maintain Stoic endurance without becoming doormats? I break down how context and role-based duties shape what it means to act justly, and I offer practical strategies for staying true to Stoic principles while setting boundaries that honor both ourselves and others.\n\nMidlife folks, click here: https://stoicismpod.com/midlife\n\nMeditations 4.5\nDeath is such as generation is, a mystery of nature‚Ä¶ not a thing of which any man should be ashamed, for it is not contrary to the nature of a reasonable animal, and not contrary to the reason of our constitution.\n\nTHREE TAKEAWAYS\n‚Äî Death is neither good nor bad‚Äîit‚Äôs a natural process necessary to life itself.\n‚Äî Stoic practice requires continual habituation, especially around fear and mortality.\n‚Äî Setting boundaries is not un-Stoic when done with reason and care for all parties involved.\n\nJoin the Practical Stoicism community, the Society of Stoics, at https://community.stoicismpod.com.

In this episode, I tackle one of the most difficult and emotionally heavy questions I‚Äôve ever received from a listener. The question challenges a central Stoic claim: if everything other than Virtue and Vice is morally indifferent, how do we account for actions that seem obviously evil?\n\nTo answer this, I break down the two definitions of ‚Äúindifferent‚Äù in Stoic thought and explain why Stoicism insists that context, not the physical action itself, determines moral value. This isn‚Äôt academic nitpicking‚Äîit‚Äôs essential for understanding what Stoicism actually teaches about justice, virtue, and moral responsibility.\n\nüîπ Why Virtue is always Good‚Äîand Vice is always Evil\nüîπ The two definitions of ‚Äúindifferents‚Äù in Stoicism\nüîπ Why horrific acts like rape are always unjust and vicious\nüîπ How Stoicism distinguishes between action and context\nüîπ Why context‚Äînot the act‚Äîdetermines moral quality\n\nThis is a difficult episode, but it‚Äôs also a necessary one for anyone who wants to understand Stoic ethics at its deepest and most serious level. If Stoicism is your life philosophy, you need to know why it's equipped to handle even the hardest moral questions.\n\nüìñ ‚ÄúIf we don‚Äôt know why something is wrong, we can‚Äôt be sure we‚Äôve gotten it right.‚Äù\n\nThanks for watching.

This story isn‚Äôt about perfection, it‚Äôs about progress‚Äîand how even a near-slip can teach us something meaningful.\n\nStoicism doesn‚Äôt promise that we‚Äôll never get angry or annoyed. But it does help us build inner safeguards that keep our worst moments from becoming something we regret. I reflect on what went wrong, what went right, and how vigilance‚Äîprosochƒì‚Äîis at the heart of every successful Stoic practice.\n\nüîπ Why I almost lost my temper on a train\nüîπ What prosochƒì really looks like in daily life\nüîπ How Stoic training changes our ‚Äúworst‚Äù over time\nüîπ Why internal safeguards matter more than strict rules\nüîπ What it means to slip without falling\n\nThis episode is a reminder that paying attention‚Äîmoment to moment‚Äîis the true bedrock of Stoic living.

My answer offers a Stoic perspective on responsibility, bandwidth, and moral prioritization‚Äîreminding us that limits are not vicious, but human.\n\nüîπ What Marcus means by ‚Äúa common mind‚Äù and ‚Äúshared reason‚Äù\nüîπ Why Stoic justice is grounded in Nature, not dogma\nüîπ How Natural Law differs from religious or legalistic moral frameworks\nüîπ Why acknowledging your limits is key to living justly\nüîπ A Stoic answer to dealing with moral complexity in modern life\n\nThis episode challenges the idea that virtue is about doing everything and reframes it as doing what is appropriate, rational, and sustainable‚Äîgiven your roles, context, and capacity.\n\nüìñ ‚ÄúIf mind is common to us all, then also the reason‚Ä¶ we are partakers in one constitution.‚Äù ‚Äî Meditations 4.4\n\nIf this helped you think more clearly about Stoicism in real life, please like, subscribe, and hit the bell so you don‚Äôt miss future uploads.\n\n#Stoicism #MarcusAurelius #Meditations #NaturalLaw #Cosmopolis #StoicJustice #VirtueEthics #DailyStoic #ModernStoicism\n\nüîó Resources & Links:\nüëâ Join The Society of Stoics: https://community.stoicismpod.com\nüëâ Buy my book: https://stoicismpod.com/book\nüëâ Read Meditations source text: https://stoicismpod.com/far\nüëâ Listen to the podcast: https://stoicismpod.com\nüëâ Follow me on Bluesky: https://stoicismpod.com/bluesky', 'id': 'QnJ339ao26M', 'is_live': False, 'length': 1378, 'stats': {'comments': 2, 'likes': 5, 'views': 167}, 'tags': [], 'title': 'Are We All Part Of One Law?

Marcus Aurelius uses the image of fire to describe the rational mind‚Äîhow it can grow stronger by consuming the challenges it faces. I break down what he means by the ‚Äúsovereign power within,‚Äù connect that to the Stoic concept of the daemon, and explore how human rationality represents a concentrated portion of the divine Logos.\n\nüîπ What Marcus means by ‚Äúsovereign power‚Äù and how it relates to reason\nüîπ Why the mind is like an earthenware pot‚Äîand why that matters\nüîπ How the Stoics understood the daemon as the divine spark within\nüîπ The role of Pneuma and Tonos in shaping rational beings\nüîπ How to approach aging parents justly, without sacrificing other duties\n\nWe also tackle a challenging listener question about navigating the demands of aging parents with outdated beliefs. I explain how habituation impacts character, and why Stoic justice‚Äînot guilt‚Äîshould guide our response to those in need, even when they‚Äôre family.\n\nüìñ ‚ÄúIt is like a fire, when it masters what falls into it‚Ä¶ a bright fire very quickly appropriates and devours what is heaped upon it, and leaps up higher out of those very obstacles.‚Äù ‚Äî Meditations 4.1\n\nThanks for tuning in.

Alongside fellow SEAL Christopher J. Chambers, Gage perished while attempting to board a vessel suspected of smuggling Iranian weapons bound for the Houthi rebels. The mission turned tragic when Chambers was swept overboard, and Gage, in a heroic act of brotherhood, dove in after him ‚Äî both were lost to the ocean‚Äôs current.\nChet, and Gage‚Äôs brother Ryan, reflect on Gage‚Äôs remarkable journey from Roanoke, Virginia, to the elite ranks of SEAL Team Three. He shares how his son‚Äôs determination and selfless character defined every part of his life, including his final moments.\nChet also opens up about the heartbreak of losing a son, the holes left behind, and the hope he‚Äôs now pursuing through the Nathan Gage Ingram Foundation ‚Äî a mission to support military families in their own times of need.\nWe also discuss the Navy‚Äôs investigation into the incident, which pointed to preventable failures, and how Chet has chosen to turn pain into purpose, even participating in a memorial paddle just miles from where his son is honored in San Diego.\nFrom personal grief to public service, from private tears to lasting legacy ‚Äî this conversation is a powerful tribute to a son, a hero, and a father‚Äôs unwavering love.\n\nIn This Episode You Will Hear:\n‚Ä¢ American Airlines pilots, called ‚Äú100 Vets Who Give a Damn‚Äù are retired pilots.

(18:05)\n‚Ä¢ He [Gage] was watching this movie one night. Afterwards, he decided to go for a 4-mile run in the ice. He came back and said ‚ÄúDad, I‚Äôm gonna be a Navy SEAL.

Brian Dickinson, a former U.S. Navy Special Operations Aviation Rescue Swimmer and elite mountaineer, joins us to share the harrowing true story of his solo summit and descent of Mount Everest after being left without a guide‚Äîand without sight. After his Sherpa fell ill near the South Col, Brian pushed onward alone to the top of the world, only to be struck by sudden snow blindness on the way down. What followed was a seven-hour descent with no vision, no oxygen, and no margin for error.\nBrian holds the record for the highest solo blind descent and has completed the Seven Summits, conquering the tallest peaks on each continent. Before his mountaineering feats, Brian served six years in the U.S. Navy with the elite NSO (Naval Special Operations) community, deploying on high-risk rescue and combat missions in the Persian Gulf.\nNow the host of Calm in the Chaos, a podcast that highlights raw, untold rescue stories from America‚Äôs unsung heroes, Brian brings the same courage, insight, and humility to this conversation. Whether you‚Äôre a fan of extreme adventure, military resilience, or human endurance‚Äîyou won‚Äôt want to miss this one.\nIn This Episode You Will Hear:\n‚Ä¢ {Marcus] I‚Äôm a Charlie Sheen SEAL.

But you can train for the things in your control. (18:07)\n‚Ä¢ You can‚Äôt acclimate to 26 [thousand feet]. You‚Äôre slowly dying. Like if you cut your finger, it won‚Äôt heal. There‚Äôs not enough air. (23:23)\n‚Ä¢ At Camp 3, this is where you see a straight up ice wall. If you fall, you‚Äôre falling for a mile. (24:32)\n‚Ä¢ When I got about a thousand feet above Camp 3, I had to anchor off to get some water. I had an oxygen mask and goggles, and I took my goggles off to put them around my wrist, and as I was getting my mask off to drink water, my foot slipped, I went to grab the rope, and my goggles slid off and 4they‚Äôre just like‚Ä¶ down. And you don‚Äôt bring extra gear. (25:35)\n‚Ä¢ There‚Äôre over 300 bodies still on the mountain. (30:38)\n‚Ä¢ You live and die by the decisions you make in life. (31:34)\n‚Ä¢ When you climb any mountain at night, the sun is your first indication of hope. (37:33)\n‚Ä¢ According to the Himalayan Database, I‚Äôm one of two people to ever have the summit to myself on a given day. (39:07)\n‚Ä¢ Everything just went completely white. I went Snowblind. And I remember at that moment, dropping down, grabbing the rope, and assessing the situation thinking: I‚Äôm at the highest point in the world, I‚Äôm completely blind; no one‚Äôs coming to get me. (41:07)\n‚Ä¢ I just witnessed a miracle. It was like someone reached down and picked me up. An unexplained energy. The first thing I did was try the extra oxygen bottle and it started working, and I got 5 full beaths ‚Äì reeling it in ‚Äì and it burned. It felt like fire going through my veins.

(6:05)\nAt a very early age, I knew what I wanted to do when I grew up. I knew that I wanted to be a Navy SEAL. (7:26)\n‚Ä¢ I was the honor graduate for my Leatherneck class. (22:49)\n‚Ä¢ I was yelling at people, and barking out things and orders. Dan walked up to me nonchalantly and said ‚ÄúJared, calmness is contagious, just talk.‚Äù I‚Äôll never forget that. (36:54)\n‚Ä¢ [During the] first turnover op between us and 7, Dan stepped on a pressure plate. Honestly, he should‚Äôve died that day, but there was a tremendous effort [to help him]. (37:23)\n‚Ä¢ Do the right thing. In that case, the right thing landed me in a spot on this television show for 2 seasons. (48:08)\n‚Ä¢ We gotta figure out who we‚Äôre gonna take. Problem is there‚Äôs no targets, nothing to shoot. So, we take water bottles, piss in them, put ‚Äòem on a fence. And the first handful of guys, commandos, that could shout those from 50 yards ‚Äì those are the guys that rolled with us. (52:14)\n‚Ä¢ I‚Äôm a warfighter. I‚Äôm not an engineer. But along the journey I met some guys who were product engineers. [We developed] a recreational division and a government division ‚Äì making turning target systems and other targets and software, making people more proficient with their firearms.

Donaldson & Captain Bradley Geary‚Äôs Journey of Service and Sacrifice\n\nThis week, Marcus and Melanie welcome Commander Jed ‚ÄúJ.D.‚Äù Donaldson, and Captain Bradley Geary to the Team Never Quit Podcast. J.D Donaldson, a West Virginia native whose journey from small-town athlete to elite Navy SEAL leader is nothing short of remarkable. Raised in Hedgesville and shaped by strong family values and athletic discipline, J.D. earned a U.S. Naval Academy appointment and went on to win two national boxing championships before graduating with a degree in Physics (Oceanography).\nSelected for SEAL training alongside a small group of peers, J.D. would go on to serve in multiple SEAL Teams across global deployments, holding command positions at SEAL Team Eight and SEAL Team Four, and leading strategic operations in Africa with Special Operations Command. His time at the elite Naval Special Warfare Development Group (DEVGRU) marks the pinnacle of a career defined by leadership, courage, and brotherhood.\nNow, as Vice President of Operations at GBRS Group, J.D. continues to serve the veteran and first responder community, equipping them with the tools and training to thrive. In this episode, we explore how his experiences shaped his approach to leadership, resilience, family, and life after service.\nCaptain Bradley Geary is a retired Navy SEAL officer with 24 years of distinguished service in Naval Special Warfare. A 2000 graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy and SEAL Qualification Training Class 234, he led elite teams across the globe‚Äîfrom SEAL Team Four to commanding SEAL Delivery Vehicle Team One. He most recently served as Commanding Officer of Naval Special Warfare Basic Training Command. Captain Geary holds a master‚Äôs in Defense Analysis and has spent his career training, leading, and mentoring some of the most elite warriors in the world.\n\nIn This Episode You Will Hear:\n‚Ä¢ I was first chair trumpet in high school. Muscular lips. (22:38)\n‚Ä¢ One of the psych‚Äôs did a study of all the attributes access the teams to find out what‚Äôs consistent across all the force. The only attribute he could find consistent with 100% of us the sense of levity ‚Äì humor. (32:12)\n‚Ä¢ In the darkest moments of our careers, you‚Äôll find the funniest things (33:20)\n‚Ä¢ There‚Äôs this one young officer standing there, smiling ear to ear. I said ‚ÄúYo dude, I just cancelled your Christmas break, they got you wet and sandy. Why are you smiling? [His response was] ‚ÄúThis is everything I was waiting for, and everything I hoped it would be.‚Äù (35:59)\n‚Ä¢ Press into the suffering. All of a sudden, it‚Äôs not enjoyable, but it changes your mindset. (36:47)\n‚Ä¢ [Marcus] McGraw had more fractures than he had legs. No quit in this dude. (47:18)\n‚Ä¢ The guy next to me, Greg Klein, a huge Green Beret and Marine Force Recon. The instructor says ‚ÄúKlein, what‚Äôre you doing here? You‚Äôre Army Green Beret; you‚Äôre Marine Force Recon. He‚Äôs like ‚ÄúI thought I‚Äôd take a break.‚Äù (48:07)\n‚Ä¢ Danny [Dietz] was probably the best pilot I‚Äôve ever seen. He was amazing. (68:31)\n‚Ä¢ We were in Chesapeake Bay, and I‚Äôm looking at the bearings. All of a sudden, I‚Äôm like ‚ÄúHey! Danny!  We‚Äôre like 90 degrees off course. What are you doing? Next thing I know, we bounce off the bottom. He had fallen asleep driving the STD. We had been out there so long that night. (68:52)\n‚Ä¢ It comes back to Who‚Äôs under the boat? Who‚Äôs carrying their weight? Who‚Äôs sacrificing for their teammates? And Danny [Dietz] was always that guy. (79:32)\n‚Ä¢ [Danny Dietz is the] most selfless dude I‚Äôve ever met. (79:58)\n‚Ä¢ Whatever he [Danny Dietz] did, he did with excellence. He just owned it. (80:25)\n‚Ä¢ It was the first time that I‚Äôd lost anybody close, and I walked out to the gravel, looked up to the heavens and I got to thinking. He was probably one of the key elements of my success in my entire career. I looked up to the stars and thought: ‚ÄúAlright Lord, If I was up there and Mike was down here, what would I say to him?‚Äù I‚Äôd say: ‚ÄúThink well of me and get back to work.‚Äù 120:54)\n‚Ä¢ I hadn‚Äôt brushed my teeth in like 84 hours. (121:53)\n‚Ä¢ Leonidus didn‚Äôt choose the 300 [Spartans] because they were the best warriors. He chose them because they had the best women. (139:21)\n‚Ä¢ Suffering produces endurance, endurance produces character, character produces hope. All the answers are right in this book.

Is he doomed to depending on the kindness of strangers with pumps, or can Tom and Ray help cure him‚Äîor at least outfit him properly in case there is an explosion? Elsewhere, towing may be Dave's best option for transporting his beloved LeMans cross-country, because the car could fall off somewhere in Nebraska; Hanz can't decide if his wife's behavior at stoplights is utterly brilliant or utterly wacko; and Elizabeth may be asking too much from her Volvo.

Elsewhere, Fred doesn\'t know whether he should listen to his mechanic or his FSTB (Future Son-in-Law To Be) on how to start the Alfa that\'s been sitting in his garage for a year. Will siding with the mechanic doom Fred\'s daughter\'s marriage? Also, Steve\'s driver\'s window glare screen is now a stuck-in-the-door glare screen; Alison\'s Golf may be suffering from a ""cracked breather"" and ""achin\' plugs""; and is Judy\'s Escort sending smoke signals that it won\'t make it to the moon?

He lost both, but he\'s kept his sense of humor, and is just kinda confused about why his Acura was the only car not towed from a party. Elsewhere, we thought nobody could be more devoted to an old heap than Tommy, until we met Lita who has written a poem about her Monte Carlo‚Äîwe\'re just relieved she didn\'t try to rhyme anything with ""rust bucket."" Also, the holiday season brings good cheer and the annual squeak to Betsy\'s Town and Country; Kate\'s temporary fix for her frozen door locks is hilarious, and incredibly dangerous; and, did the hottest man in show business set Melinda\'s radio on fire?

Tom and Ray think Evelyn should just say a few kind words to the deity of her choice and move on, but will nonetheless offer a pseudo-scientific answer that's guaranteed to have MIT demanding its diplomas back. Elsewhere we find out if Bob's wife's car survived sucking a sock into the engine on Stump the Chumps; Gary's steering noise is scaring away his girlfriends; and did Barbara do more damage to her husband's truck, or her marriage, by driving a mile without any oil?

And why can't Bob stop laughing about his Geo's starting problem? Elsewhere, Alan's Lincoln is starting to sound eerily like his mother; Karen's Caravan's dashboard is telling her she's always going 120 miles per hour on an empty gas tank; Steph wants to tempt the Blowout Gods by removing his Miata's spare tire so he'll have more trunk space; and Ariel is thinking of buying her first car and is wondering what level of protection she needs to bring to the dealer.

In this episode, I‚Äôm sharing a message that hit me hard‚Äîand I know it‚Äôs going to resonate with you. We‚Äôre talking about the weight of yesterday‚Äîhow comparison to your past or to where you thought you'd be can keep you stuck in a loop that doesn‚Äôt serve you. But here's the truth: your past isn‚Äôt a life sentence. It‚Äôs a lesson. And most of the time, we‚Äôre not even remembering it right.\n\nI walk you through why your brain is constantly editing your memories and how those stories you keep replaying may not be 100% true. More importantly, I give you a roadmap for breaking the cycle‚Äîbecause if you don‚Äôt challenge the story, you‚Äôll keep living it. I also share how I reframed my own story with my dad and what I learned by choosing the meaning I gave to my past instead of letting it define me.\n\nYou‚Äôll get four specific tools you can start using right now‚Äîlike ‚Äúfuture-focused journaling‚Äù and ‚Äúmental rehearsal‚Äù‚Äîto shift your state and take control of your story. Because the second you align your thoughts and your actions, you start creating real momentum. And momentum? It beats memory every time.\n\nLet‚Äôs make a decision together‚Äîto stop asking ‚ÄúWhy did I do that?‚Äù and start asking ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs next?‚Äù You don‚Äôt owe your past an apology. But you do owe your future a shot. So grab the pen. It's time to write a new chapter.\n\nKey Takeaways:\n\n- Why comparison to your past or expectations keeps you stuck\n\n- The truth about memory and how it‚Äôs often inaccurate\n\n- How to use ‚Äúmental rehearsal‚Äù to rewrite your inner narrative\n\n- Four practices to shift from rumination to creation\n\n- The mindset that unlocks real momentum and growth\n\nYour story isn't over.

This show is sponsored by GrowthDay.\n\nWhat if everything you believe about success is actually slowing you down?\n\nIn this conversation with Dr. Benjamin Hardy, we get real about why most people aren‚Äôt achieving at the level they‚Äôre capable of‚Äîand how to flip that. I told Ben right at the top of the show: our last interview turned heads. The kind of feedback we got‚Äîfrom everyday entrepreneurs all the way up to CEOs of billion-dollar companies‚Äîwas off the charts. This one picks up where we left off and goes straight into the truth about scaling your business, your mindset, and your life.\n\nDr. Hardy breaks down why the goals you‚Äôre setting might be too safe‚Äîand how that safety is the very thing killing your growth. We talk about setting what he calls ‚Äúimpossible goals‚Äù with unreasonable timeframes, not because they‚Äôre flashy, but because they strip away every single thing that‚Äôs slowing you down. ‚ÄúFalse goals create intensity,‚Äù he says, and that‚Äôs where most people get stuck. The real key? Letting the future‚Äînot your past‚Äîshape your decisions today.\n\nI open up about my own realizations. I thought I was a future thinker. Turns out, I was still leaning on the past more than I realized. And if you're scaling anything beyond just yourself, that mindset's got to shift. We get into what it really takes to lead with conviction, how to simplify your systems, and why being radically honest with yourself is the start of all exponential growth. This episode isn‚Äôt just theory‚Äîit‚Äôs the real talk you need if you're tired of playing small.\n\nIf you‚Äôve been stuck in complexity, distracted by too many paths, or trying to do five things at once, this one‚Äôs going to hit home. Ben says it best: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre kept from our goal not by obstacles, but by a clear path to a lesser goal.‚Äù That‚Äôll preach.\n\nKey Takeaways:\n\n- Why short timeframes eliminate all the false paths\n\n- The difference between bold goals and truly impossible goals\n\n- How to stop lying to yourself and simplify your system\n\n- What it takes to scale beyond yourself‚Äîand why most never do\n\n- How to develop unshakable conviction and operate as a signal in a noisy world\n\nListen now, and get ready to start thinking and executing in a whole new way.\n\n‚Äî Max Out\n\n\nMain Points:\n00:00 Intro\n03:32 Simplifying Scaling\n04:47 The ‚ÄúFrame, Floor, Focus‚Äù Scaling Framework\n08:05 The Power of Impossible Goals\n11:29 Why Impossible Timeframes Are Key to Massive Growth\n18:54 Inspiration From Moonshot\n21:16 Be Honest With Yourself & Quit the Wrong Stuff Faster\n23:30 Linear Thinking vs. Disruptive Scaling\n26:04 How to Scale Beyond Yourself\n30:09 Conviction Is the Currency of Scaling\n32:46 Signal vs. Noise\n35:49 Accountability: The #1 Trait of Elite Companies\n37:18 How to Get Rid of Noise & Distraction\n39:07 How Technology & AI Change What‚Äôs Possible\n40:32 Why a Properly Set Goal Is Already Halfway Done\n46:18 Holistic Time & Rewiring Your Past, Present & Future\n\n\nThank you for watching this video‚ÄîPlease Share it and get the word out! \n\nüëá SUBSCRIBE TO MY YOUTUBE CHANNELüëá\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIprGZAdzn3ZqgLmDuibYcw?sub_confirmation=1\n\n‚ñ∂Ô∏é Visit My WEBSITE  |  https://www.EdMylett.com\n\n#EdMylett #Motivation"", 'id': '8rz6SSDSASg', 'is_live': False, 'length': 3093, 'stats': {'comments': 45, 'likes': 584, 'views': 14218}, 'tags': ['ed mylett', 'mylett', 'the ed mylett show', 'maxout', 'maxout with ed mylett', 'podcast', 'show'], 'title': 'What If You Could Achieve Your Biggest Dreams FASTER?

You‚Äôre going to hear what it really takes to make the impossible, possible.\n\nWyc Grousbeck shares how he bought the Boston Celtics without having the money upfront‚Äîand why chasing a vision bigger than yourself can become your life's banner. Damar Hamlin opens up about his miraculous comeback from cardiac arrest, and how choosing to get up‚Äîeven in the ugliest seasons‚Äîchanged everything. Andre Ward breaks down what separates champions from everyone else: it‚Äôs what comes out of you when you get knocked down. Fallon Taylor walks us through her terrifying accident that left her paralyzed and how sheer determination, grit, and gratitude brought her back to the arena. And Dr. Taryn Marie offers the kind of clarity and emotional honesty we all need, especially around resilience and the power of becoming the ‚Äúone‚Äù who breaks the cycle in your family.\n\nEvery one of these conversations points back to one truth I believe with everything in me: the best ability is availability. Just being willing to keep swinging when others quit is the difference.\n\nKey takeaways from this episode:\n\n- Why having a clear vision‚Äîand not the resources‚Äîcan be enough to start.\n\n- What to do when you hit rock bottom and need to rebuild from scratch.\n\n- How to keep moving when life blindsides you with trauma or setbacks.\n\n- Why some dreams require more than passion‚Äîthey demand a fight.\n\n- The small rituals that build unshakable resilience over time.\n\n- The real difference between a dreamer and a finisher.\n\nI want you to walk away from this episode not just inspired, but convicted. There‚Äôs candy in your life‚Äôs pi√±ata. You just have to keep swinging. Keep hitting. Even when you‚Äôre tired. Especially when you're tired. Because that‚Äôs when most people quit‚Äîand that‚Äôs exactly why you can win.\n\n\n\nThank you for watching this video‚ÄîPlease Share it and get the word out! \n\nüëá SUBSCRIBE TO MY YOUTUBE CHANNELüëá\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIprGZAdzn3ZqgLmDuibYcw?sub_confirmation=1\n\n‚ñ∂Ô∏é Visit My WEBSITE  |  https://www.EdMylett.com\n\n#EdMylett #Motivation"", 'id': 'n5hXKv1RzUo', 'is_live': False, 'length': 6365, 'stats': {'comments': 17, 'likes': 219, 'views': 5136}, 'tags': ['ed mylett', 'mylett', 'the ed mylett show', 'maxout', 'maxout with ed mylett', 'podcast', 'show'], 'title': 'What It Takes to Make Impossible Dreams Come True', 'transcript': None, 'youtubeVideoId': 'n5hXKv1RzUo'}, {'age_restricted': False, 'airDate': '20250717', 'categories': ['People & Blogs'], 'description': ""üëá SUBSCRIBE TO MY YOUTUBE CHANNEL - so this show can reach more people üëá\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIprGZAdzn3ZqgLmDuibYcw?sub_confirmation=1\n\nClick the Link Below to Subscribe to my email list to MAXOUT your life (all value, no fluff) \nhttps://konect.to/edmylett\n\nüí• Get my exclusive Monday Motivation training in GrowthDay, the world‚Äôs #1 app for advanced mindset and personal development.

I sat down with Dan and Andrea Kotter, a couple whose journey through tragedy, faith, resilience, and relentless love has inspired me to my core. Dan fell 35 feet off a roof and was left paralyzed from the waist down. Andrea met him after the accident, while going through her own unimaginable heartbreak. But neither of them let their pain define them‚Äîthey chose to build something even greater instead.\n\nThis isn‚Äôt just a story about surviving. It‚Äôs about rebuilding‚Äîphysically, emotionally, spiritually. Dan could have given up. Instead, he pushed through years of surgeries, chronic pain, and loss, while Andrea stood by his side, not seeing the wheelchair, but the strength that conquered it. They‚Äôve blended families, faced down trauma, and raised six incredible kids, all while showing up on social media to shine light into other people‚Äôs darkness.\n\nWe talked about what it really takes to choose joy when life hands you suffering. How faith‚Äîreal, grounded, daily faith‚Äîcan carry you through when nothing else makes sense. How sometimes your life falling apart is exactly what‚Äôs needed to put you on the path you were meant for. And how you don‚Äôt need some ‚Äúperfect‚Äù story to make a difference‚Äîyour real life is enough. Their content has saved lives. It‚Äôs made broken dads rethink fatherhood.

Marcus Stanley was shot eight times at point-blank range, left for dead in the street, and in that moment, he saw what he believes was an angel standing between him and every bullet. I needed you to hear from this man because Marcus isn‚Äôt just here to tell a story about survival‚Äîhe‚Äôs here to remind us what it means to keep going when everything around you says it‚Äôs over.\n\nMarcus and I talk about the dark years that followed his shooting, years where painkillers turned into addiction, and addiction turned into heroin. We talked about what it feels like when your life gets blown apart, and you have to learn how to walk again, literally and spiritually. Marcus told me it was forgiveness‚Äîreal, hard, gut-wrenching forgiveness‚Äîthat unlocked his freedom, even though the men who tried to kill him never paid for what they did.\n\nAnd you‚Äôll hear how Marcus went from a man chasing fame as a musician to a man who wakes up every day asking, ‚ÄúHow can I serve?‚Äù His faith became real not in the moment he was shot, but in the quiet, hidden years of service and surrender afterward, staying in a treatment center for four years to help others with no pay, no spotlight, just a calling to be there for the one person who might need hope that day.\n\nMarcus‚Äô story isn‚Äôt about surviving a tragedy; it‚Äôs about what you do after you survive. It‚Äôs about taking one more step when you don‚Äôt know if you can, believing that God‚Äôs not done with you yet, and choosing gratitude for every breath, every step, even if you feel pain with each one. I want you to hear this conversation because if you‚Äôre feeling like you‚Äôre on your back right now, Marcus‚Äô journey will remind you that you‚Äôre never alone, and you can get back up.\n\nKey Takeaways:\n- Why Marcus believes forgiveness was the key that broke his chains of addiction\n\n- What it felt like to see an angel while being shot at point-blank range\n\n- The hidden years of service that shaped Marcus into the man he is today\n\n- How to find hope and take one more step, even when you feel you can‚Äôt\n\n- Why your suffering can produce endurance, character, and hope if you let it\n\nIf you‚Äôve ever questioned whether God is with you in your lowest moments, or if you‚Äôre carrying your own scars‚ÄîMarcus‚Äô story is your reminder that you are held, you are loved, and you are here for a reason. Share this with someone who needs to know it‚Äôs not over. God bless you.\n\n\nMain Points:\n00:00 Intro\n5:22 The Night of The Shooting\n14:05 Surviving 8 Gunshot Wounds\n21:50 The Long Road To Recovery\n26:39 Marcus Then & Now\n30:03 Physical Healing\n33:05 Battling Addiction And Finding Forgiveness\n39:45 Four Years of Hidden Transformation\n43:21 Finding His Voice And Purpose\n48:33 Forgiving His Perpetrators\n51:34 Advice For Going Through Tough Times\n56:31 Recent Health Crisis And God's Continued Protection\n1:00:08 Recalling The Angel\n1:02:00 Marcus' Message To The World\n\nThank you for watching this video‚ÄîPlease Share it and get the word out! \n\nüëá SUBSCRIBE TO MY YOUTUBE CHANNELüëá\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIprGZAdzn3ZqgLmDuibYcw?sub_confirmation=1\n\n‚ñ∂Ô∏é Visit My WEBSITE  |  https://www.EdMylett.com\n\n#EdMylett #Motivation"", 'id': 'Y7lqxO-SMy4', 'is_live': False, 'length': 4071, 'stats': {'comments': 299, 'likes': 3060, 'views': 48144}, 'tags': ['ed mylett', 'mylett', 'the ed mylett show', 'maxout', 'maxout with ed mylett', 'podcast', 'show'], 'title': 'This Man Survived 8 Bullets and Addiction.

Even though I was a successful sales rep, making great money, I knew I had taken the ‚Äúsafe route.‚Äù\nI woke up every day with no energy, feeling unmotivated. I partied every weekend to numb myself. My relationships were struggling too, especially with my girlfriend. It all hit a low when my CEO told me I was close to losing my job.\nThat was my wake-up call. I asked myself, ""If I fast forward 10 years, do I want to be selling for someone else, or do I want to change lives and make the world a better place?"" The answer was clear.\nI realized that I wanted freedom, have unlimited income, and travel the world. But most importantly, I wanted to leave a legacy and help others.\nSo, I took the leap and started my own business as a life coach.\nIt wasn‚Äôt an easy journey but I kept going.\nIn just 5 years, I went from $100K in my old job to over $775K as a life coach. I traveled the world, and my relationship thrived - we\'re married now and have the most beautiful baby boy. Today, I‚Äôm living the life I once thought was impossible.\nI have never been happier or more fulfilled. I created a life that seemed so out of reach back then but now it is a reality.\nIf you‚Äôre reading this and you‚Äôre stuck in a 9-5 job, feeling trapped and unfulfilled, know that you too have the potential to make a difference in the world and live the life you truly want.\nIf you‚Äôre wanting to grow your own coaching business, I want to help you create your success story.\nComment ‚ÄúTELL ME MORE‚Äù below.

Listen all the way to the end of an episode. \n\n - This simple action greatly improves the Listen Through Rate or Consumption Rate on a podcasters dashboard. Effectively giving your favourite podcaster feedback that will make them üòÉ This is also a valuable metric for any podcaster approaching sponsors. \n\n2. Leave a comment on the episode. \n\n- Spotify, YouTube, and a few other podcast players give listeners the option to leave a comment. By leaving a comment on your favourite podcaster\'s content, you provide social proof for new listeners. This interaction, in some cases, can improve a podcast engagement score.\n\n3. Rate the show with 5 stars. \n\n- Think of this as a stamp of recommendation. Like leaving a Google Review for others to find, by giving your favourite podcaster\'s show a 5 star rating, new listeners will select new shows to add to their rotation based on the overall rating score. \n\nWhat does all of this communicate to your favourite podcaster? \n\n""I love how you made your podcast, keep creating!""\n‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nThese are my three things.

On the evening of March 30, Jonathan asked to sleep in the downstairs guest bedroom. In hindsight, a few details about that conversation were slightly unusual, but nothing raised alarm. By the next morning, everything had changed when his mother went to wake him for school and found that Jonathan was missing. His iPad and headphones were gone, but his phone and jacket were still in the house.\n\nSearch teams combed the neighborhood and nearby areas. Surveillance footage was gathered from neighbors, but Jonathan was not visible on any of the cameras. No one reported seeing him, and no physical trace of Jonathan was ever found. As time passed, his family began to believe he was not just lost, but that someone may have taken him.\n\nSince Jonathan has autism and is considered an endangered missing person, his family expected law enforcement to treat the case with urgency. Instead, they encountered one obstacle after another. They continued searching, but much of the work fell on them and members of the community who offered support without having access to the tools or authority that law enforcement holds.\n\nAt the center of all this is a disconnect. Jonathan‚Äôs family is certain he could not have simply walked away and started a new life because needed daily support. Yet from their perspective, law enforcement seems to have built a narrative that he did exactly that.\n\nThis week, we will examine what happened after the initial searches ended, the investigation, the community response, and a recent development that has brought new hope: possible sightings of Jonathan in Kirkland, Washington.\n\nFollow search efforts on social media at Help Us Find Jonathan Hoang - Endangered & Missing Person.\n\nA $100,000 reward is currently available for information. If you see Jonathan, please call 911.

Later, he returned to say he wasn‚Äôt feeling well and asked to stay home from school the next day. His father said to wait and see how he felt in the morning. Around 8 PM, Jonathan told his dad he was heading to bed downstairs. It was a small deviation from routine that was odd, but not alarming. The next morning, Jonathan‚Äôs mother went to wake him for school and found that Jonathan was gone.\n\nJonathan is on the autism spectrum and has always lived a quiet, structured life. He spent most of his time at home with his family or at school, where he was enrolled in a transitional program for young adults designed to help them build independent living skills. He was a creature of habit, and his routines brought him comfort. One of those routines was walking the same path through the neighborhood. He always wore a jacket, even on the hottest days. That jacket became a part of how neighbors recognized him. When he disappeared, the jacket was still inside the house. The items missing along with him were his iPad and earbuds. \n\nJonathan's family called the police immediately. Search and rescue teams canvassed the area, but no sign of Jonathan was found.

Despite extensive efforts, no clues surfaced. Dave‚Äôs family was left to reexamine every detail and possibility.\n\nThat morning, Dave asked his wife to drive him to meet someone about a property. But who was that person? Why was his truck parked oddly? And what about the neighbor‚Äôs report of a white truck at the house?\n\nFrom the start, Dave‚Äôs loved ones felt his case had been dismissed as a medical emergency, just an older man who wandered off. But when searches turned up nothing, they believed something more was going on.\n\nFor more than a year, the case stayed cold. Then, something unexpected: a grave was opened in Starkville Cemetery. It was supposed to contain one man. But inside were two.\n\nThe coroner claimed both had been buried in 2019, before Dave vanished. But the man who performed the exhumation said the second body seemed too intact. That stopped the Shier family in their tracks.\n\nDave‚Äôs wife couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling she had when watching the footage; those legs in a body bag looked too familiar. Could Dave have been buried without anyone ever telling his family?\n\nNo matter who the second man was, what they saw, and how it was handled, deeply disturbed the Shiers. They believed no one should be buried without dignity.\n\nThey pushed for answers and change. The Colorado Bureau of Investigation launched an inquiry into what had unfolded.\n\nThis week, we take you inside that investigation, what it revealed, how it ended, and where the Shier family stands now.\n\nIf you have information about Dave Shier‚Äôs disappearance, contact the Las Animas County Sheriff‚Äôs Office at 719-846-2211. #TrueCrimePodcast #MissingPersons #MissingPerson #Disappeared #Vanished #UnsolvedCase #UnsolvedMystery #UnsolvedMysteries #ColdCaseFiles #TrueCrimePodcasts #TrueCrime #TrinidadColorado #LasAnimasCounty #MissinginColorado', 'mediaType': 'image', 'mediaUrls': ['https://instagram.fkiv8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-15/514297500_18408813364108524_886670718844699994_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080_sh0.08_tt6&_nc_ht=instagram.fkiv8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=100&_nc_oc=Q6cZ2QFan1_mOIyLLEpNPquD99aZGEZarXJQQ6VnsjLz0YIAvdI9G_N_qHi55S1DSspU0UM&_nc_ohc=YiElnREVRO4Q7kNvwG23htX&_nc_gid=KDBGHjd_LaIY_2alf-pYWA&edm=AOQ1c0wBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfRn50RNshwYs5jYXoA9af9redPephUiQ5sSCCXjqVcTjw&oe=6889AFBA&_nc_sid=8b3546'], 'postId': 'DLiQ4GIuK_b', 'postUrl': 'https://www.instagram.com/p/DLiQ4GIuK_b/', 'stats': {'comments': 10, 'likes': 98, 'views': 0}, 'timestamp': 1751308901}, {'caption': ""Last week, in Part 1 of David Shier‚Äôs story, you heard about his sudden and unexplained disappearance from Trinidad, Colorado, on February 11, 2022. Dave‚Äôs wife recalled that he asked her to drive him somewhere because someone had called about a property. She didn‚Äôt know more than that, but Dave was frustrated with her because she already had plans to run errands for one of their daughters. She last saw him around 11 AM, and when she returned later that afternoon, Dave was missing.\n\nWhen Dave didn‚Äôt return and no one had heard from him, his family reported him missing. Given his age and the unusual circumstances, law enforcement took the case seriously and launched immediate search efforts. A snowstorm that night forced them to pause, but searches resumed the following morning and continued for months, even years.\n\nClues began to surface: the unusual positioning of Dave‚Äôs truck, and a report of a white vehicle spotted at the home. Then came a crucial discovery, a neighbor‚Äôs trail camera footage, which law enforcement initially overlooked due to technical limitations. The neighbor eventually found an image of Dave walking away from the property around noon on the day he vanished. That footage is the last known sighting of him.\n\nDespite extensive efforts, no trace of Dave was found, and the case went cold. Then, more than a year later, there was a strange twist in the case when the local coroner came under fire after the body of a man was exhumed, a man who had been considered a missing person for several years. They found two bodies inside the grave where there was only supposed to be one. \n\nSuddenly, David Shier‚Äôs case was back in the spotlight, and the Colorado Bureau of Investigation launched a broader inquiry into potential misconduct in Las Animas County.\n\nIn this episode, we follow the strange and disturbing developments that brought new attention to Dave‚Äôs case, and explore the question: could he be the second person buried in that grave?\n\nIf you have any information regarding the disappearance of David Shier, please contact the Las Animas County Sheriff's Office at 719-846-2211.\n\n#MissingPerson #MissingPersons #TrueCrimePodcast #TrueCrimeCommunity"", 'mediaType': 'image', 'mediaUrls': ['https://instagram.fkiv8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-15/503622262_18407882941108524_3972833667108832304_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080_sh0.08_tt6&_nc_ht=instagram.fkiv8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=100&_nc_oc=Q6cZ2QFan1_mOIyLLEpNPquD99aZGEZarXJQQ6VnsjLz0YIAvdI9G_N_qHi55S1DSspU0UM&_nc_ohc=cyxi2_t5uoMQ7kNvwFufirh&_nc_gid=KDBGHjd_LaIY_2alf-pYWA&edm=AOQ1c0wBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfTYxc9zXBH4LN9hWyOVnlqPY1ZIdeLe5KqOeR2t0Er0Ug&oe=6889C26F&_nc_sid=8b3546'], 'postId': 'DLQckqESrKM', 'postUrl': 'https://www.instagram.com/p/DLQckqESrKM/', 'stats': {'comments': 5, 'likes': 134, 'views': 0}, 'timestamp': 1750711053}, {'caption': ""On February 11, 2022, David Shier disappeared from his home in Trinidad, Colorado. That morning, his wife, Rosemarie, saw him around 11 a.m. before she left to run some errands. When she returned later that day, David was no longer there. She tried calling him, but he didn‚Äôt answer. She also reached out to friends and family, but no one had seen or heard from him. As the hours passed and David failed to return home, the family decided it was time to report him missing.\n\nDavid‚Äôs truck was still parked at the house, so the assumption was that he may have left on foot, possibly heading to his workshop in the neighboring town of Starkville. Deputies checked the shop, but David wasn‚Äôt there. They combed the path between his home and the workshop but found no sign of him.\n\nLater, it was discovered that a neighbor‚Äôs trail camera had captured David walking away from his property on the day he vanished. However, it wasn‚Äôt enough to determine where he was going or what may have happened next. Despite extensive searches of the surrounding area, not a single trace of David Shier was ever found.\n\nThe trail seemed to go cold. Then, nearly a year later, something unthinkable happened. A scandal broke involving the Las Animas County Coroner. Allegations surfaced about secret burials, financial misconduct, and the mishandling of human remains. During an exhumation, a horrifying discovery was made: instead of finding one body, investigators found two.\n\nFor David Shier‚Äôs family, the possibility was chilling. They wondered if the unidentified body could be David. The mystery surrounding his disappearance only deepened, leaving his loved ones with more questions than answers.\n\nIf you have any information regarding the disappearance of David Shier, please contact the Las Animas County Sheriff's Office at 719-846-2211.\n\nListen to Part 1 of David Shier's story wherever you get your podcasts.\n\n#DavidShier #MissingPerson #MissingPersons #TrueCrimePodcast #TrueCrime #TrinidadColorado #UnsolvedCase #Disappearance #ColdCase #TrueCrimeCommunity #TrueCrimeStory #UnsolvedMystery #UnsolvedMysteries #UnsolvedCases #ColdCaseFiles #Disappeared #Missing #LasAnimasCounty #MissinginColorado"", 'mediaType': 'image', 'mediaUrls': ['https://instagram.fkiv8-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-15/506021875_18406885024108524_4477257337802955813_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080_sh0.08_tt6&_nc_ht=instagram.fkiv8-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=100&_nc_oc=Q6cZ2QFan1_mOIyLLEpNPquD99aZGEZarXJQQ6VnsjLz0YIAvdI9G_N_qHi55S1DSspU0UM&_nc_ohc=3zKWwWpmZb4Q7kNvwFGljYT&_nc_gid=KDBGHjd_LaIY_2alf-pYWA&edm=AOQ1c0wBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfTzQagQu_Z7ciLPXaz2XQjT15o5EBMbHqCGyuW-NHDdzw&oe=68899689&_nc_sid=8b3546'], 'postId': 'DK9o-5FORFo', 'postUrl': 'https://www.instagram.com/p/DK9o-5FORFo/', 'stats': {'comments': 4, 'likes': 123, 'views': 0}, 'timestamp': 1750080025}]}",[]

At the Stanford Seed Summit in Cape Town, South Africa, three GSB professors explored why real connection is built through authentic communication.\n\nFor\xa0Jesper S√∏rensen, authentic organizational communication means talking about a business in ways customers or investors can understand, like using analogies to relate a new business model to one that people already know. For incoming GSB Dean\xa0Sarah Soule, authentic communication is about truth, not trends.

At the Stanford Seed Summit in Cape Town, South Africa, three GSB professors explored why real connection is built through authentic communication.\n\n\nFor Jesper S√∏rensen (https://www.fastersmarter.io/guests/jesper-srensen/) , authentic organizational communication means talking about a business in ways customers or investors can understand, like using analogies to relate a new business model to one that people already know. For incoming GSB Dean Sarah Soule (https://www.fastersmarter.io/guests/sarah-soule/) , authentic communication is about truth, not trends. Her research on ""corporate confession"" shows that companies build trust when they admit their shortcomings ‚Äî but only if those admissions connect authentically to their core business.

According to Emily Falk (https://www.fastersmarter.io/guests/emily-falk/) , the real secret is simpler: know what your audience finds relevant, and you‚Äôll be able to craft a message that resonates.\n\n\nFalk is a professor of communication, psychology, and marketing at the University of Pennsylvania, Vice Dean of the Annenberg School of Communication, and director of the Communication Neuroscience Lab. In her book What We Value: The Neuroscience of Choice and Change (https://www.fastersmarter.io/what-we-value) , she reveals that our brains have what she calls a ""social relevance system"" ‚Äî our ability to understand what other people are thinking and feeling. ""I use social relevance as this kind of catchall for these thoughts about what other people are thinking and feeling, which also helps us predict what they\'re gonna do and how we might communicate successfully with them,"" she explains.\n\n\nIn this episode of Think Fast, Talk Smart (https://www.fastersmarter.io/) , Falk and host Matt Abrahams explore how to put this insight into practice, from the power of storytelling to leveraging ""neural synchrony"" to create shared understanding.

I collaborated with the incredible team at Exploding Kittens (@gameofkittens), and it‚Äôs been play-tested by 100+ families and groups in multiple countries. Now, it‚Äôs finally ready for primetime.\n\nCOYOTE! It‚Äôs an addictive card game of hilarity, high-fives, and havoc. You can learn it in minutes, and each game lasts around 10 minutes.\n\nBut how did this all start?\n\nAs a kid, Dungeons & Dragons was my best friend. It kept me safe from bullies and captured my imagination. Under the hood, it also taught me teamwork and‚ÄîI honestly believe‚Äîmade me smarter.\n\nDecades later, the game Poetry for Neanderthals made me laugh until I cried. I tracked down Elan Lee (@mrelanlee), one of the world-class game designers behind it, and we did a podcast together. We‚Äôre similarly weird and quickly became close friends.\n\nIt wasn‚Äôt long before I began to wonder: ‚ÄúMight I be able to make a game that‚Äôs simple and hilarious (like Poetry), but one that also makes you smarter and is hard to master (like D&D)?‚Äù\n\nElan was an immediate YES, and‚Ä¶ now we have it! \n\nCOYOTE is now available at @walmart (or link in bio) online and in 3,200+ stores across the US. The game will be available at Target, Barnes & Noble, and internationally for our friends abroad later this summer. Stay tuned. Lots of fun stuff coming.\n\nAnd if you try it out, please share videos of you playing! I‚Äôm so excited to see it in the wild. \n\nJust use the #coyote #coyotegame hashtags, and I‚Äôll be sure to find you.', 'mediaType': 'video', 'mediaUrls': ['https://instagram.fitb1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-15/505174300_18515081149042033_2882949870942244216_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e15_fr_p1080x1080_tt6&_nc_ht=instagram.fitb1-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=101&_nc_oc=Q6cZ2QGFA70aX36EP2mnug-vwbnJMA_VUer2mSwDqU_sGFCDVq8hULw023LKRkKrDV2t6c0&_nc_ohc=1SOAGZbse4MQ7kNvwHvY8qv&_nc_gid=Sf-bWN8aw62t9WHQ8UiO5g&edm=AOQ1c0wBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfSNQ4uiZdKYJj-mS2_nQ_9IP0PJ6J5-Xe-lwVefl5T_jA&oe=6889B9CD&_nc_sid=8b3546'], 'postId': 'DIPEDY7vkn5', 'postUrl': 'https://www.instagram.com/p/DIPEDY7vkn5/', 'stats': {'comments': 130, 'likes': 4419, 'views': 56002}, 'timestamp': 1744222955}, {'caption': 'NEW podcast episode is up! \n\n‚ÄúRhonda Patrick, Ph.D. ‚Äî Protocols for Fasting, Lowering Dementia Risk, Reversing Heart Aging, Using Sauna for Longevity (Hotter is Not Better), and a Few Supplements That Might Actually Matter‚Äù\n\nYou can find my interview with Rhonda on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube, or wherever you get your podcasts.', 'mediaType': 'image', 'mediaUrls': ['https://instagram.fitb1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-15/523029277_18522922345042033_5925917744939729662_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_s1080x1080_sh0.08_tt6&_nc_ht=instagram.fitb1-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=101&_nc_oc=Q6cZ2QGFA70aX36EP2mnug-vwbnJMA_VUer2mSwDqU_sGFCDVq8hULw023LKRkKrDV2t6c0&_nc_ohc=cd6yDc4oafcQ7kNvwHczyJM&_nc_gid=Sf-bWN8aw62t9WHQ8UiO5g&edm=AOQ1c0wBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfT-LKjgK0BTR1cEL0QUn_R4d_v2VKrsLw7SjXxHq3C54w&oe=6889B55A&_nc_sid=8b3546'], 'postId': 'DMiWTAPMFyZ', 'postUrl': 'https://www.instagram.com/p/DMiWTAPMFyZ/', 'stats': {'comments': 3, 'likes': 290, 'views': 0}, 'timestamp': 1753459226}, {'caption': 'The brain-boosting power of creatine. \n\nMy brand-new interview with Rhonda Patrick, Ph.D.  is now available!\n \nRhonda Patrick, Ph.D. is a biomedical scientist and the founder of FoundMyFitness, a platform dedicated to delivering rigorous, evidence-based insights on improving healthspan and mitigating age-related diseases.\n\nYou can find my interview with Rhonda on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube, or wherever you get your podcasts.', 'mediaType': 'video', 'mediaUrls': ['https://instagram.fitb1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t51.2885-15/523107669_1479306923242040_4244005676978862986_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e15_tt6&_nc_ht=instagram.fitb1-1.fna.fbcdn.net&_nc_cat=108&_nc_oc=Q6cZ2QGFA70aX36EP2mnug-vwbnJMA_VUer2mSwDqU_sGFCDVq8hULw023LKRkKrDV2t6c0&_nc_ohc=P7OBGGA3zs0Q7kNvwHTm0kJ&_nc_gid=Sf-bWN8aw62t9WHQ8UiO5g&edm=AOQ1c0wBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfQ2fFE0XRB7YjkXtmmhuC1-XGT8vi4XsC4Wh5DP4smcOw&oe=6889BFD0&_nc_sid=8b3546'], 'postId': 'DMiHEGKMN8f', 'postUrl': 'https://www.instagram.com/p/DMiHEGKMN8f/', 'stats': {'comments': 67, 'likes': 1678, 'views': 29435}, 'timestamp': 1753451346}, {'caption': 'Sign up for ‚Äú5-Bullet Friday‚Äù and each Friday you‚Äôll get a short email from me sending you off to your weekend with fun and useful things to ponder and try.

We discuss the joy of nurturing plants and the transformation of lawns into productive gardens.

We talk about their vision for the future of cities, city as a learning machine, children‚Äôs opportunities to network, protests, and many more. \n\nAaron Stupple is a practicing physician and father of five in Western Massachusetts. He has been promoting critical rationalism and the work of Karl Popper and David Deutsch since 2019 in the form of online community building, a web magazine, and Rat Fest, the annual in-person conference in Philadelphia.

He collaborates with physicists, edits science works, hosts Rat Fest, and co-founded Conjecture Institute.\n\nThe Sovereign Child, a book authored by Aaron Stupple and edited and junior authored by Logan Chipkin, advocates for the Taking Children Seriously philosophy, asserting that children, like adults, should have the freedom to make their own choices without parental limits, as their reasoning and emotions function similarly. Drawing from his experience as a father of five, Aaron critiques the harms of rule enforcement and explores surprising alternatives that prioritize respecting children‚Äôs reasons as equally valid.\n\nFind out more about Aaron, Logan, and The Sovereign Child through these links:\nAaron Stupple\xa0on LinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/in/aaronstupple/)\n@astupple\xa0as Aaron Stupple on X (https://x.com/astupple)\nAaron Stupple\xa0on the Tim Ferriss Show (https://tim.blog/2025/01/18/naval-ravikant-sovereign-child/)\nLogan Chipkin\xa0on LinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/in/logan-chipkin-0a246677/)\n@ChipkinLogan\xa0as Logan Chipkin on X (https://x.com/ChipkinLogan)\nThe Sovereign Child\xa0- book by Aaron Stupple and Logan Chipkin (https://www.thesovereignchild.com/)\nTaking Children Seriously\xa0website (https://takingchildrenseriously.com/)\nThe Conjecture Institute\xa0website (https://www.conjectureinstitute.org/)\n\nConnecting episodes you might be interested in:\nNo.294 - Interview with Erick A.

This power can be used to expose family secrets, betray a nation, or communicate loving words that were never uttered aloud. \n\nThis is a real genre-bender, blending WWII-era historical fiction, grounded fantasy, family drama, and queer romance, all with compelling characters and an original and propulsive plot. Readers may also be drawn to the sweet grandmother/granddaughter relationship, close look at Chinese history, and thoughtful exploration of questions concerning data, privacy, and who owns our stories.', 'mediaType': 'image', 'mediaUrls': ['https://scontent-gig4-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/503716694_18514360288021802_7141216850695658525_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e15_fr_s1080x1080_tt6&_nc_ht=scontent-gig4-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=102&_nc_oc=Q6cZ2QGSaPcF5yhxd24Ep3pacH_f1RC9o0M4-VkA3FQsLieqGbRCnS6z-zEQzFMezC_TOmc&_nc_ohc=p8q1NytG2HAQ7kNvwFoxRT1&_nc_gid=Z8ofGDpyKEl35OCL63USeQ&edm=AOQ1c0wBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfQJapXtuQNpT_rqDIFfSKtq5Fp5a_1-RhIcVTiMrv9qBg&oe=688AE0C6&_nc_sid=8b3546'], 'postId': 'DLkwIHTu2s6', 'postUrl': 'https://www.instagram.com/p/DLkwIHTu2s6/', 'stats': {'comments': 6, 'likes': 239, 'views': 0}, 'timestamp': 1751392396}, {'caption': 'I‚Äôm a long-time fan of Kevin Wilson‚Äôs work and absolutely thrilled he‚Äôll be joining us to discuss this month‚Äôs @mmdbookclub selection Run for the Hills.\n\n@kevinwilsonauthor deftly combines the heavy and the light in this found family story of four scattered half-siblings who meet for the first time and pile into an old PT Cruiser to go find the father who abandoned them long ago.

About one in five teachers said they had the freedom to choose all of their texts, with one in five also saying none of the texts were their choice.\u2060\n\u2060\nThe National Council of Teachers of English says the report is the most comprehensive look at what is being taught by English teachers since a 1989 federally funded survey done by State University of New York researchers.\u2060\n\u2060\nRead more at the link in our bio.', 'mediaType': 'image', 'mediaUrls': ['https://scontent-bsb1-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.2885-15/524593446_18523201732021070_3796527608818629394_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_e35_p1080x1080_sh0.08_tt6&_nc_ht=scontent-bsb1-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=102&_nc_oc=Q6cZ2QFBxG0Yg__QCynehibgIsf2yT-qCpfgpzinerVqQ8OszFvgNCwHwwjTh8ZF9e4Snl0&_nc_ohc=fdw96uUMrkoQ7kNvwEYIM37&_nc_gid=qXvG874mEk0S62PggasICA&edm=AOQ1c0wBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfTaM1Z3nBi8G5mA3dzxdPb1vTvSGsgdzkDQunJbfjf43w&oe=6889C46E&_nc_sid=8b3546'], 'postId': 'DMg2Ksiz0us', 'postUrl': 'https://www.instagram.com/p/DMg2Ksiz0us/', 'stats': {'comments': 350, 'likes': 8703, 'views': 0}, 'timestamp': 1753408830}, {'caption': ""Hulk Hogan, who died Thursday at age 71, could pull off exceptional athletic feats with his massive, sculpted, 6-foot-8 body, writes sports columnist Jason Gay.
